       "{'2006 Q1': \"Thank you very much. I am Son of SoftBank. Recently every day from the morning until late I am very much focused on the mobile phone that really fills up my mind. Now, I look back the Vodafone KK, we are very happy that we could acquire Vodafone KK. I think it was a great timing and I think we were very lucky to be able to acquire Vodafone KK. It's a great company. I think it was one in a million opportunity for us. Of course, the competitors are great competitors and they're working very hard so it's not going to be easy competition or easy race, we fully know that. But in three years, five years or 10 years, I think that we are fully capable of competing and I am feeling more and more confident recently about, the key word now is adult SoftBank or mature SoftBank. So we're not going to be anything outrageous. But the four issues, or four challenges are network coverage enhancement to make sure that we have the coverage or so that you can have the connection over the time. The second challenge is to enrich the handsets to offer attractive handsets to the customers. The third is enhancement of the content, so that people can enjoy and utilize the content; we need to offer such content. And fourth is the brand image. Establish the brand image and through the sales channels and marketing try to improve our brand awareness. So those are the four challenges. And if we can make improvements in all four areas I think we'll be able to compete fully. In other words, the mobile phone services or functions until now were not totally satisfying to the customers. I think to the users and customers we'd like to offer services so that we can move them and touch other customers. We'd like to provide such services and products. That has been something that I strongly feel. And if we can achieve that, or if we can realize that, we'll be okay. So in order to realize it what do we need to do? First of all, I'd like to look at the earnings results and business performance of the other Group companies for this earnings results announcement. So I'd like to talk about the first quarter results. First of all, the consolidation of the Vodafone KK, or after the acquisition starting from the 1 of May, Vodafone KK was consolidated. And the second point is that we have had a continuous positive earnings trend. Those two are the highlights of the earnings results. Turning to page three, net sales 494 billion, for the full year this would be four times higher, so about 2 trillion yen level in terms of net sales. We have grown to that level. EBITDA 104.3 billion, operating income 54.3 billion, ordinary income 25.9 billion, income before taxes 29.3 billion. On the right-hand side you see the year-on-year comparison increases. As you can see we have significantly increased in each item. Looking back the first quarter FY '06 the ordinary income was minus 3.1 and ordinary income was minus 13 billion yen. So compared to that a year later we have made significant improvements. So the company has improved and expanded the business results in the past year. Turning to page four, the net sales by business are shown here. The e-commerce looks down or smaller, because the way that we book the sales has changed; it started with the SoftBank distribution. For example, the sales of Microsoft the absolute number was booked as a net sales, but starting with this quarter only the gross profit is booked in the net sales. So the accounting procedure has changed, so actual net sales keeps growing, although this looks smaller. Turning to the operating income, as you can see, in 2003 the first quarter, quarterly number was 24 billion negative compared to that this quarter 54 billion yen in operating income. Since the foundation of our company this is the biggest, highest operating income. We have grown to that level. So we have realized and reshaped recovery. Now looking at the breakdown, the third and fourth quarter last year we have already disclosed those numbers. The ADSL modem rental business was sold so there was a temporary gain or income from that; tens of, billions of yen were booked. And excluding that, you can see that we have been growing steadily in our operating income. And the Vodafone portion 27 billion yen, we are earning this level of operating income in the Vodafone KK business. Now, the operating cash flow can be calculated by deducting the CapEx from the EBITDA. So EBITDA is very close to the operating cash flow. In the past three months we have generated 100 billion yen positive. So after the beginning of the EBITDA we were negative in EBITDA so we have quickly improved this EBITDA figure. Our non-operating income, the interest expense is included here. Those are the numbers as you see. With this acquisition of the Vodafone we formed a bridge loan and the cost from the structuring of the bridge loan, this is for the procurement of the bridge loan so this is a temporary cost. And this cost was about a little less than 20 billion yen. So this is the temporary expense, which is under others. Next is the ordinary income, which is 25.9 billion yen, this is 39 billion increase year on year. As mentioned before, in the third and fourth quarter of last year, we sold off the modem business, so there was a one-time revenue, and if we deduct that we can see that we are registering a very favorable growth. Net income is indicated over here, and as mentioned before, we have one-time special cost for the bridge loan and that is included in this figure. And this is the graph of net income. And as you can see, the trend we are definitely making a steady V-shaped recovery. And on page 12, you see operating cash flow and it is self-explanatory. We acquired Vodafone and we have to see what kind of impact there will be on the operating profit. And this is assuming the future scenario. When we start a broadband business in four and a half years we had upfront investments, so we were growing through some painful periods. We had to have the infrastructure and we have the customer acquisition cost. And it was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it started from nil and we do not have any track record. It was very costly and also we had to define in the business model and it was time consuming as well, but now we are registering surplus here. And in terms of Japan Telecom, we acquired this company about a year and a half ago. During the first year, we had upfront investment and we were in the red, but now we are enjoying surplus. As far as Vodafone is concerned, as mentioned before, in terms of operating profit we are in the black. Actually, Vodafone had surplus, so we are leveraging on that. So as compared to other businesses that we have started up, we are in a very good position and there are 1.5 million users and also the business is in the black. So based on that in the second and third quarter what will be the scenario? By the end of this calendar year we will continue upfront investment. We will like to have proactive upfront investment and to prepare ourselves for the future growth. Number of portability will occur in the end of October. According to the newspaper it is October 24 and so we should be prepared for number of portability. Having said that, starting from October, we will try to have a brand change and we are making press releases related to this, and also, in terms of design and interior signage we are making due changes. Also, in terms of base stations, we are increasing numbers so that we can expand our coverage. The details will be given later, but no matter where you are in Japan, no matter what time you are making calls, you will be able to be connected. And that is the ideal future that we are envisioning. And in order to materialize that we have plans to install new base stations. So we will have upfront investments in the second and third quarter. So during that time in terms of operating profit we will do upfront investment in the level that will not lead us to a negative figure. So compared to our broadband upfront investment, which took about four and a half years, and in terms of fixed line and Japan Telecom, it took more than a year. But in terms of Vodafone and Mobile Communications within a period of a few months of upfront investment we will be able to enjoy the current recovery. Number of portability is an event onto itself and we will make the brand changes, but this is only a one-time cost. And so, there are special expenses that will be incurred only once. And so that is the begun of the upfront investment that we will be making. So I am very sure that we will be able to enjoy the curve relatively quickly. In terms of the bridge loan it was 1.166 trillion and this is non-recourse LBO bridge loan. But in the consolidated balance sheet it is included in the liabilities and net assets. And we added a non-recourse LBO bridge loan figure in the current liabilities. And in terms of cash and cash equivalents, even after the acquisition in the end of June we still have sufficient cash and cash equivalent and there is unused portion on commitment line, which is 30 billion yen. And in terms of net debt we have a non-recourse LBO loan and we do have to register that. But other than that we see favorable trend in terms of the consolidated net debt amount as well. And in terms of the Vodafone acquisition-financing plan, on the 27th of April, we formulated our acquisition bridge finance and this bridge loan is due by the end of March 2007. So in due course we will try to switch to a long-term and diversify financing in sometime around in the end of September. And so, the temporary bridge loan should be converted to some form of permanent loan by the end of September, and we are working accordingly to meet our target date, and things are moving very favorably. Last week we sold off all the SBI Holdings shares and sales proceed was 136 billion, and in terms of gain on sales, it was 65 billion yen. We will be reallocating management resources in the telecommunications and Internet business. We would like to focus our management resources and we would like to use our capital most efficiently, and also, we will be able to payback the loan that we have. Now, let's move onto the main presentation topic, which is the mobile business. Please take a look at these four charts. On the left-hand side, upper part, you have the subscriber and 3G ratio amongst all the subscribers that we have. In terms of Vodafone, the 3G area was lagging behind as compared to other operators. Nonetheless, you see a steady shift from 2G to 3G, and recently the speed is accelerated. ARPU of 3G is higher as compared to 2G, so we would like to increase the ratio of 3G. In terms of ARPU per subscriber, it has been showing a downward trend. In terms of the fourth quarter, it was 5,600 yen. But in the first quarter of this fiscal year it was 5,590 yen, so there has been a decrease of only 10 yen. So if we can increase the ratio of 3G I am sure that total ARPU will go up. Now as far as the churn rate and upgraded ratio are concerned, we see some steady trend. In terms of subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber, it has been showing upward trend for some time, but now we are seeing a steady situation. Let's take a look at four commitments, which I have already mentioned at the outset. We would like to overcome all these four challenges. What is the first challenge? It is 3G-network enhancement. There are so many areas where we cannot provide connection. I myself use a Vodafone terminal everyday ever since the acquisition of Vodafone. There is no problem when I use it on a day-to-day basis however, I would like to further enrich the coverage. And that is the first plan that I have on mind. By the end of this year we would complete most of them, and at this moment about 23,000 base stations. And AU has more than 10,000 and DoCoMo has more than 20,000, but in our case by the end of March next year we would like to increase the base station number to 46,000. And DoCoMo's target is 44,000, that is gross that number, so we'd like to be higher than that, so 46,000 is our target. AU is more than 10,000 right now and 800 meg better; a more advantageous frequency was given to them. So AU has had that advantage until now. But at least the license and permit, we don't want to use that as an excuse. From the customer's perspective this does not concern them, so for the customers, even if the cost is too high, even if it is difficult, we'd like to improve the coverage and make sure that the customer has a good connection. So rather than making excuses or using that or those reasons as excuses, we'd like to complete this enhancement of the coverage by increasing the number of the base stations. That's what we have been doing. As for the materials and construction, personnel, we have already completed making preparation. And as for the fundraising for that we have already almost completed the fundraising. The second challenge or commitment is to make our handsets more attractive. After the acquisition among the one segment capable handsets the most popular handset has been the AQUOS handset. As a one-seg handset it has been number one in sales ranking. And among these Japanese made mobile phones the SLIMIA, the thinnest 3G handset was launched in June and this has been extremely popular. There has been a lot of shortages of the SLIMIA in many different places. So compared with the existing handsets, Vodafone's image was for very thick handsets, it looked as though it was only for the overseas. It was not acceptable by the Japanese consumers. That was the case in two or three years, but this has been improving very quickly. Other handsets will be launched one after another into the market so we are currently working on that. The third commitment is the content. Yahoo! Will be fully utilized. And in addition to that with Disney this is the first content distribution with Disney. This is the e-comics for the mobile phones as well as games. We are launching this. And Vodafone Live is available. This is just like i-mode of DoCoMo or Easy Web of AU. So we have Vodafone Live and inside it there is Yahoo! Japan, it's at the top of this menu. So by inserting this line from that day, the first day, the access to the Yahoo! via Vodafone increased six times \\xe2\\x80\\x93 six fold right away. So I think that the users were very hungry for this type of service by using the mobile phone accessing the Internet or to see the content via the mobile phone. It was very inconvenient until now. So as soon as we launched this the access increased six times. So we would continue to make this even more easier to use, so that the Yahoo content will be converged to the mobile phones. We are making preparation for that now. So in our handsets very soon there will be a Yahoo button. If you push that button you would be connected to Yahoo. So this is something that we will be doing very soon. By doing this Yahoo auctions, Yahoo news, Yahoo travel, mail those can be utilized very conveniently and very easily, very quickly. So that's something that I would like to offer. Starting from October 1st I'd like to start this service using the Yahoo button, so that will be the service in date of Yahoo button. The fourth commitment is the sales structure and also increasing the brand awareness. This service starting from October 1st was already mentioned. And in terms of sales, for example, for the corporate customers there were only about 100 people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the sales people for the corporate customers. But Japan Telecom has 1,500 staff members in the sales team. So the Vodafone Japan or Vodafone KK did not have a good foothold for the corporate customer. So now we can fully utilize the Japan Telecom sales team to increase the number of the staff by 15 times, so we can create the synergy effect from that, and we are already making preparations for that. And the other day we made this announcement. For example, in the Talki area there is a company called Talki Group. For the ADSL Talki Group is number one in Talki area. And in Talki area we cannot beat Talki or NTT cannot beat Talki. So Talki Group is number one in that region. So in the other MVNO method, in other words by using our own mobile network we would lease that network to Talki Group. And we have reached an agreement with Talki Group and we will be working on the details for the content of the business alliance, but we have already agreed upon the direction. And our consumer broadband businesses, our optical fiber ADSL or cable, we will be collaborating with Talki Group. There will be various ways of collaboration with them. We, the SoftBank Group, as an IP company is, I believe, number one. We are proud to say that. And the backbone of that is the 100% IP network that we have and we are the only ones who have it. NTT is talking about their Next Generation Network and they have announced their Next Generation Network. And probably in five years, I believe, they will be completing such Next Generation Network. They have announced this concept. But in our case five years ago already the fully IP network was established. So in that sense what we did five years ago is something that NTT is going to achieve in five years. So that shows you that we were truly the leading edge in terms of that technology the fully IP backbone, a 100% IP backbone. We have, we are the only one who has such a backbone network, so the strength and also the very advanced technology of the IP network. Those are the areas that we would like to fully take advantage of in the mobile and other areas. Five years ago we started the broadband services and everything was the first time for us. The acquisition of the customer was very difficult. We started truly from zero but after that we grew those businesses and now 26 million lines users are already established. So in terms of the household it's more than 20 million households. There are 47 million households in Japan, so that's quite a significant number, 20 million households. And 26 million plus Yahoo! charging or billing customers, they are premium members. They are more than 6 million customers, paying customers. And it's a Group company there is GungHo. They also have the paying customers. So if you add all that actually we have even higher customer base, more than 30 million paying customers in our customer base. As mentioned before, we have a most innovative fully IP network and it is already configured. In the US there are telecommunication operators and cable operators and also Internet providers exist. And there are operators who complain that they do not want a content provider to use their infrastructure free of charge. And the President of NTT in Japan formally and officially mentioned the same comment. But I think such a comment is against a new wave. Those people are angry that, that users use the internet too much and video average contents are being enjoyed. And the operators are mad that they would like to charge the content providers. But I think it is completely opposite. That is to say content providers are important partners and users should be free of stress and they should be able to use broadband as much as possible, as much as they want. Therefore, the users and content should not be restricted. But rather, we have fully IP network, so we would like the consumers to use our infrastructure as much as they want and enjoy content that require a wide pipe. And in order to accommodate that kind of a world we have been implementing innovative technologies and we have the so-called Next Generation Network that is a fully IP network, and this is our strength. And Japan Telecom and Vodafone network will be completely integrated with our fully IP network. We have broadband infrastructure and who is enjoying the most? The answer is Yahoo! Japan. And I have been mentioning that on day one and I'm sure that we are proving our comment. Page view of Yahoo! Japan with the advent of broadband, page view is increasing and in a day 1.2 billion page view is enjoyed in Japanese newspaper and magazines. Even though you add up all the pages, 1.2 billion page view is larger in number than the aggregated figure. When we started Yahoo! BB ADSL the competition became very tough and some people said that ARPU might go down. Many analysts as well as journalists mentioned that there is a danger of ARPU going down. But in actuality in terms of ARPU it has been showing a steady growth. There has not been any exception in terms of a quarter, i.e., on a quarterly basis we have been increasing our ARPU, because we have been providing new value added services, leveraging on the technologies, so that we can realize highly value-added services and functionalities to our customers. We have very innovative services as well as content and we are going to further advance on these three areas. Having said that, what is our company value? We have visible assets on the balance sheet, but atop that we have factors that are invisible, i.e., not on the balance sheet and you can see those factors building up. We have our track record, i.e., company performance and unrealized gain and on top of that we have the capability to increase our profit in the future and we are strengthening that area. We have proactive advanced investment and by doing so we are transforming ourselves to an entity that can secure further competitiveness as well as profitability. So then the Group's enterprise value is going up. We have put a full push effort in the past and that has been converted to material performance figures. Let's compare ourselves with other groups. In terms of ISP, Nifty was the number one company. Dial up was the Internet access. And during that time NTT had the market share of 99%. However, what is the present situation in terms of ISP? Yahoo! Japan is number one. Centering around Yahoo! BB, Yahoo! Japan is unsurpassed number one and in terms of broadband and ADSL connection. In terms of NTT it has NTT East and NTT West. And in terms of the NTT to NTT comparison sometimes Yahoo! BB is unsurpassable number one. In terms of mobile communication, I'm sure that we can follow suit. Anything that happens twice can happen thrice, and can happen the next time around. Starting from narrowband to broadband, the main player changed. In terms of the fixed phone and the main character or player will change. And in terms of mobile there is a shift from narrowband to broadband. And we're talking about mobile broadband, and with the advent of new era, the current main player will not necessarily continue to be a main player. And I am forecasting the future and I am giving the future prediction. So we are seeing new evolution of the Internet. The Internet has been used for search, as well as communication, but will be a platform for daily life. So in the past hardware centered usage of the Internet was the main usage. It was for communication, it was for search. But it will become the platform for the daily life. So it will provide more convenience and fun to people at large. So with the advent of the new era, it's not the technology or hardware centric, but rather it will be centered more on the content and entertainment. Why do we use the name SoftBank? I am sure that the name unto itself will prove itself in the future. And let me give you one example, which is G-Planet; we gave a press conference related to G-Planet last week. We had Mario Golf or Golf For Everybody. Camelot is a company that sells those programs and we have a partnership with Camelot. And we try to open up a new area for the game and we want to come up with new entertainment platform. And we are getting very good feedback from the users along with GungHo. As a Group we would like to further reinforce the online game and also create a community of game players. Also we have a partnership with COA. We have the world's first MMO, it's not RPG but MMO action game will be realized. SoftBank Group's network is fully IP network so the speed which is mandatory for action games is there; you press a button or you use a mouse and there is a timing between the time that you press the button and a sword for example will be moved. And usually there is latency between the two actions but we will be able to compress that latency to several millisecond. And in terms of our action program our network can accommodate high speed where latency is very short. And due to our IP network we can provide that and COA realizes that and we have exclusive partnership with COA. And starting from autumn we will launch this service officially. Also the biggest talent agency and the model agencies we have working with Oscar Promotions. And we have had a contest with the audience participation, it's to choose or vote for the beautiful girls just like Kumiko Goto who has chosen one of them. And Oscar, this contest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many of those celebrities actresses were chosen in those contests. So we are working with Oscar and we have the first contest with the audience participation and the total votes were 156,000 and applicants were more than 5,000. So it was a very big reaction from the people. And the 30 minutes episodes, there will be ten episodes in total and we are preparing and manufacturing or producing those episodes now. Also using the broadband there is horse race tickets, which can be bought over the Internet or you can see the video of the race on the screen. This was already offered. And another example is the citizen participating news site. The biggest news site OMI News is in Korea, so we have established a joint venture with them. And starting from 21st of last month, we had people applying as citizen's reporters. It has been less than one month but we have already had 560 registered reporters for the OMI News. So they would register as reporters, and already this number exceeded 560. So the media itself will change with the broadband. So as you saw in those examples, SoftBank has the strongest IP Internet protocol network and also Yahoo as a platform. On top of that network we have various content services. So, as a total service we are not just the telecommunication service company. SoftBank is not just comprehensive telecommunication service provider; rather we are the comprehensive information service company who would like to offer a new lifestyle to people. So it's not just hardware or infrastructure but we'd like to offer a total information ecosystem. A lifestyle company in the 21st Century is our definition. Having said that, the mobile users, how can we increase the number of the customers and how can we satisfy them? That would be the competition. So we would make sure that we would be able to win in that competition. We'd like to provide excitement to our customers.\",\n",
       " '2006 Q2': \"Thank you very much for the introduction. I am Son of Softbank. Now the number portability started a week ago, and at the beginning, there were a lot of confusion with system failures and related issues. I would like to take his opportunity to apologize for any inconveniences that you had, and after the holiday, I think that the customers' procedures have become possible and it's going to move at the end of this week. Not only the new customers but the existing customers' procedures are started. And we are, during a lot of our procedures of changes, but starting with today for the existing customers, we would have the service until 8 PM instead of 7 PM just like the new customers, so we would be able to accommodate the existing customers until 8 PM. During the weekend that we just had, it was till 8 PM for new customers and for the existing customers we accepted the application by fax until 6 PM and 8 PM over the computer, using the computer. So, we are still going through the adjustments but we are over the major problems and that's for the ads, and some people criticized that the part of the ads are misleading so we took the initiative to change our ads, and fortunately many people said that the content of our services are now understandable and we are improving the content of the ads which are becoming more and more easy to understand. At the startup, we had a lot of issues and I am very sorry for that, and again, I would like to express my apology and this is really my responsibility, not anyone else. I think that I am the person responsible for the issues we had, but we would like to make sure that we will be able to compete in the long run. Now, let me start with the earnings results. First of all, this is the summary or highlights of this quarter. Now the number portability started and we started the full fledged competition in the mobile business. The second point is, our business performance since the beginning of Softbank, we achieved the highest profitability ever and I will talk about the details of the numbers later. And the Vodafone acquisition and the refinancing in relation to that, switching over to the long-term borrowing to the one-time borrowing and we have chosen to use the securitization for the refinancing, and the schedule for the completion has been finalized and we have received the commitments from the participating financial institution. Now, let me start with the first half consolidated earnings of FY '07. Sales 1 trillion, 120 billion EBITDA, 228 billion operating income, 112 billion ordinary income 62.2 billion, income before taxes 118.8 billion and net income 14.4 billion yen. Now comparing with the first half of '06, we have made a major improvement in all of those items, as you can see on this slide. Starting with this half from this slide, we'll being showing the graph. First of all, net sales. Steadily, we are increasing the first half net sales numbers. Five of the mobile communications in the first half, it seems that some of them are down, but the software distribution business and others have different booking methods. So gross profit is booked rather than the net sales, for example, the Microsoft product say that 10,000 softwares are sold, and instead of having 10,000 yen as our net sales. Our gross profit would be booked as our net sales, so the booking method has changed, so the net sales appear to be lower but the actual net sales have increased, rather than decreased. The operating income is this slide. A year ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unto a year ago, we were in red, and in 2001 and 2000, we started since the beginning of the FUBB [ph] and broadband, we were in deep debt, but we have generated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 started to generate at the operating income and the first half of last year was 4.4 billion in operating income and its share is 112.5 billion yen. Compared with the second half of last year, we have doubled the operating income, so this is the largest ever-operating income that we have realized. This is the break down of that. Mobile communications business is 56.6 billion yen. Non-mobile communications in the second half of last year is in pink here, that is FUBB modem rental business. This was securitised, so it was sold to outside. So, the one-time gain was about 14.6 billion yen and this was booked as operating income last year, but this is a one-time operating income. So, we have disclosed this number in the past. So in that sense, the non-mobile communications business is increasing in their operating income or profits. Now EBITDA is shown here, 2020 or 220 billion is already picked up. In the western nations they become as even more important item rather than the operating income, ordinary income. So it's very close to operating cash flow, if the actual profit from the operation sold under 20 billion EBITDA was achieved. So compared with second half, '06 it got doubled. If you compare with the last year first half, this is quadruple four times higher. So very quickly, our business our performance is improving, just the ordinary income, 62.6 billion Yen, so this is largest ever since the foundation of the company. The net income is shown here. The second half '06, Alibaba in China, Tao Bao was sold \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Tao Bao was sold, so that gain and one-time income was included, and excluding that one time profit, we are making a progress and you can see the overall trend from this graph. Let's take a look at the quarterly numbers. As we can see over here, over numbers are improving. It is explanatory and I would like to share the graph with you. And just that some are annual numbers we are following the same trend and in terms of the quarterly numbers, e-commerce accounting principle changed, but otherwise you see improvements in the numbers in all the business. Operating income of by quarter is shown on this chart, and the first quarter, I mentioned about the third and fourth quarter last year, and we will have a branch changes and also in terms of the increase of the base stations, most probably, we will encounter a lower in number in the third and fourth quarter of this fiscal year and I mentioned about those possibilities, and I have warned about those aspects, but in actuality due to the operational efficiency, we were able to reduce the expenses. We have Yahoo, BBS of Bank BB and also we have the mobile businesses and also we have the fixed-line telecom, ex-Japan Telecom, we have three different networks and in the past, we had three different sales departments, we had three different management teams in the past. That was the structure in the past. But, I myself, assumed the presidency of those three entities and I'm consolidating the Management those three organizations. So that is a symbolical act that I have conducted and increases our sales and technology department, as well as the management. We are consolidating the three organizations and network was, we are trying to completely consolidate the three networks that we have, of course it is time consuming, but we were able to conduct those activities in a study manner. Therefore, even though we had the increase of a Base stations we were able to observe those extra costs and eventually we were able to increase the profit. Let's take a look at the breakdown of the operating income. As mentioned in the semi-annual number, in terms of Pro Bank [ph] BB, we sold the modem rental business and the pink portion shows one-time profit and interest of the mobile communications as indicated here, you see profit. And in terms of the first quarter, it was 27.2 billion and in the second quarter it was 29.3 billion. So, even though we had to make prior investment, we are still making improvement in the operating income. Nonetheless, in the third and the fourth quarters there will be more competitions in the sales department area. And in March of next year, we will continue increasing the number of the base stations and we will take aggressive movement in the prior investment. Having said that, in the third and the fourth quarters, in the mobile communications business, in terms of the operating income we will not incur any deficit. We will incur surplus, but nonetheless we will have a much prior investment eCapital investment. So, in the third and fourth quarter, the operating income will shrink because of the increase of the capital expenditure. We have Japan and telecomm and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I have mentioned that whenever we start new business such as Japan Telecom business, it takes about half a year to have much surplus and in terms of Japan Telecom, it took us about a year to incur a surplus, but at this time around, it will take us about half a year, whereas in terms of BB, it took us four years to record surplus. So we are shortening the span to get surplus. Let's take a look at EBITDA. We are making steady progress in this area as well, and we have largest ever. Let's take a look at non-operating profit in terms of interest that is dedicated as expense, it has increased from 6.9 billion to 17.9 billion. But in terms of operating income, we have the amortization of goodwill as well, and we have different factors that we have to consider. So, all in all, we are able to increase the operating income. And in terms of the ordinary income, due to the refinancing, we will have non-operating cost. It was a short-term loan but now it is refinanced into long-term borrowing. So, in the third quarter, we will have one-time expense due to refinancing. So, our non-operating expense will increase in the third quarter and let me warn you that, that will definitively happen. Emphasis and details of the net income. This is the graph showing the net income. In the second half of last year, we had \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the net income increased because of sales of different business activities. This is our operating cash flow, and ever since we started Internet business, people say that we are not increasing our operating cash flow, therefore, Softbank Group, as if it is in the corporate organization investment entity. But looking at the operating cash flow, we were able to register above 120 billion in cash flow. Let's take a look at operating income by segment. As shown here, on a quarterly basis, you see ups and downs. But, trend wise, you see a believable trend. In terms of the mobile communications, it is increasing very steadily. Kind of talking about EBITDA, you see what I have been mentioning in a more conspicuous manner. Let's take a look at net debt. Our profit is increasing, but our debt is increasing as well. Nonetheless, in terms of the, across mobile communications business operating cash flow, it is very favorable because we have acquired the entity that has been incurring operating cash flow, and we were able to refinance this more than 1 trillion yen, because we have purchased or acquired the organization that had operating cash flow in surplus. So, in terms of this net debt, this is healthy net debt. Other than the acquisition of Vodafone, we have borrowings as well and the details are indicated here. And the number is steadily decreasing from 531 billion yen to 454 billion yen. Let's talk about securing financing or financial flexibility, where we are disclosing commitment line number as well as a Euro notes issuance, and we're trying to expand the scope of investors. We refinanced Vodafone acquisition borrowings. From all the pertinent financial institutions we were able to get the commitment. So, whole business securitization is underway. This shows the details. Next, I will like to talk about the key management indicators of mobile communication business. In terms of subscriber number, at the time of Vodafone, the number went down, but we bought them out. And later on I will tell you about the net increase. In short, we can say that we are making a steady improvement. And in terms of the churn rate other than mobile number affordability, churn rate is decreasing. Looking at ARP of both AQUOS bottom up and then afterward, we are making an improvement. As far as the average acquisition cost per gross addition, it is stabilized. In terms of Vodafone, Japan had many 2G subscribers. That was the majority and ARP per 2G compared to ARP per 3G subscriber is fundamentally different, but the difference is the same amongst the operators. But in terms of the proportion of 2G versus 3G, 2G was the majority of Vodafone subscribers. But as you can see here, 3G-subscriber proportion is steadily increasing. And in terms of 3G subscriber, ARP is higher than that of 2G subscribers, has business model wise we believe that this is a viable business model. Let's talk about the progress on four commitments. The first point, is the 3G Network expansion, the coverage and the number of the Base Station and so forth. We are making progress, we believe, every month. The number of the Base Station is being increased and around March next year, as we announced, 46,000 Base Stations will be achieved. As of the end of September it was 24,000 and compared with the end of our June, it was the increase of 1,700. In terms of population coverage, it's 99.97%. This population coverage is the percentage used in our industry. The 46,000 Base Station next March, several \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if others are delayed a few months, please do not criticize us too harshly. I just wanted to let you know that now, so that we can avoid any strong criticism when there is a delay of a few months. But basically, our basic direction is that the study every month we are increasing the number of the Base Station. And so far, 46,000 Base Station, probably there could be some, a few month of differences but the major direction towards that number is unchanged. And the coverage area is going to be increased drastically with this. Now, our customers. We have been doing the survey on the satisfaction in terms of the coverage, we do that every month. And with the higher number of the base station the customer satisfaction is improving \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has improved nine points and every month we have been seeing a increase in this customer satisfaction therefore. And I personally, until we acquired Vodafone K.K. In the past more than 10 years, I used a DoCoMo handset. And switching over to Vodafone I was myself concerned about the coverage. But now, at the beginning for two or three months I had two phones, two cell phones because I was concerned. But in the past few months, I have only cell phone that is Softbank handset and I only use one phone and does not cause any inconveniences, so the coverage is improving. Once in a while, if you go to the hostile [ph] area of the suburb or if you go the golf coarse you might have the bad connection. But basically for your daily life there are no problems with the coverage and I personally view that. With the Residential User, there are some customers who have a difficulty of having the good coverage, so for those people we are building the home antenna that we developed and its a proprietary home antenna that we developed ourselves and they can install this antenna on the balcony and they can receive the signal and they can set up this antenna inside the room, it is just about the size of the lunch box. So, if you install that or if you place that inside, then out of ranges houses or connection houses, in most of the cases, they can have a much-improved connection. So, this is a kind of our secret weapon that's how we successfully developed. And starting with the government while going through the procedure with the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communication, we are starting to install these equipments and for those customers, who have a finished installation and they are very satisfied. And we are installing these equipments free-of-charge for those people who have difficulty having good connection inside the house. So this home antenna is something that we are offering free-of-charge to those customers and they are quite satisfied. So, we would like to increase the number of installations. And the high-speed home network is another area, the HSDPA network. By the end of October we have over 3,000 base stations and in terms of the user coverage it is about 70%. So 70% coverage, now has this HSDPA high-speed, so, we would see the series of new handset for this. The second point is the [indiscernible] enrichment. Ready, we made announcements year-to-date, the slim \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most slim handset 12.3 mm and the largest variety of colors, 65 different colors and highest functioned camera, 5 million pixels and three times high optical zoom functions were added. So, we already made announcements of these. The thinnest handset, or shopped at 705SH SLIMIA. That was the most or thinnest phone and it was number one sales for two consecutive months, even thinner ones, I think SLIMIA was 17 mm, so even thinner phones. Four different phones will be launched and three of them are already available and there will be another one available in December. In terms of their different colors, two handsets by the end of this month. We would make announcements and in addition to those two, we plan to have 15 models in 65 colors. Vodafone Japan, in summer and winter, they announced a several different models and their average was about six models. And this time we are announcing 15 models and in terms of colors 65 different colors in 15 different models. So we are enriching the handsets very drastically as you can see in this graph. So you would never say that we have a weakness in the variety of handsets and there we know such criticism for Vodafone or Softbank mobile. So, this graph shows our enthusiasm or willingness that you provide rich handsets. Compared with other company, the same time last year, we launched 7 and AU-8 and DoCoMo 11, that was last year status. And at the same time in this year, we are launching 15 DoCoMo 8 AU-12 models. So, by the end of the year, the number of the new models, which would become available, we have the highest number in our industry. In terms of number of colors, the same time last year, half of the colors were offered by DoCoMo, 34 different colors. But now, this time we would be offering 65 different colors. So, that is about half of the total in our industry. So, the thinnest and the richest variety, I believe would be the slogan that we can use for the Softbank mobiles. The thin doesn't mean that my hair is thin, but is the thinness of the handsets, of course. The third point is the enhancement of the content. Until now, the Vodafone mobile compared with DoCoMo had the least number of the content and also compared to AU I think that was the variation. But on the 1st of October, we introduced the Yahoo-Button and formally the Yahoo-Button started to function. So if you push this button, you can go directly to the mobile site or [indiscernible] we made that change. And I myself use this everyday and once you use it, you find out that it is extremely convenient. And the search enquiry compared with September, it was more than three times and our page view in terms of page view is 34 times compared with June, so very quickly this is being widely used. This is the graph, is a representation of that. With Yahoo Ketai, you see the Vodafone in yellow and you see Yahoo Ketai in red. And as of October 1st, the number of queries and searches increased by three fold. As you can see from this graph that the subscribers are instantaneously switching to Yahoo Ketai. And with the introduction of Yahoo Ketai, you see the increase in page view and as compared to June it is more than 8 times, and you see this dramatic increase at the chart. And to the Vodafone at top page, we have link to Yahoo top page. Just by having the link as compared to June, we have 8 times more page view. So, as compared to the end of June, we are seeing an increase. And as of October 1st, we are enjoying dramatic increase and so as compared to the end of June, we have 8-fold page view increase. Another dramatic increasing number is top page with the advent of Yahoo!-Keitai and a top view increased by 34 times as compared to the end of June. End of June is right after we acquired Vodafone; we completed the purchase or acquisition in the end of May. So, when you compare the page view, our top page view of the end of June, with that the correct number with the advent of Yahoo!-Keitai increased more than 34 times, and turns as the information search in the past. A mobile has not been used to look at the varieties of content, but I myself use Yahoo!-Keitai to look at different contents, whether it be sports or weather, or stock price or any news I can get free of charge via Yahoo!-Keitai. I just press a button, and when you press this Yahoo! button, you can easily access the information and the number is 34 times, which is a very dramatic increase, actually speaks for itself meaning that the existence of Yahoo!-Keitai button was of detrimental importance to the subscribers. And also, you can access Internet services anywhere, every time, whether it be Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Calendar, Yahoo! Address Book or Yahoo! Messenger, you can access this service-oriented server by either a mobile handset NCC. We started mobile security based on our Yahoo! BB experience; we can have mobile security in the handset area as well. And also we have [indiscernible] the new style of Internet services that can be enjoyed via the mobile handset. The fourth key point is enhancement of sales structure and branding. We have caused some confusion, but we introduced incredible discounts under the name of Gold Plan, Orange Plan and Blue Plan, and we are very confident regarding the content of these plans. And I would like to compare the details of these plans later on. You can easily migrate from other operators, and in order to accommodate that, we introduced new plans under the names of Gold, Orange, and Blue. Let's take a look at subscriber's status in October. Net ads is 22,000 in [indiscernible], and in terms of MNP port in, we have 31,000 and MNP port out is 35,000 and gross ads other than MNP is 182,000, and churn other than MNP is 144,000. There are many subscribers who leverage on MNP, but there are people who do not mind changing their mobile number. They would like to pay less and would like to switch over to new carriers SAP, and there are many such subscribers. So, in total, we have net adds as indicated here is a 22,800. This is the status as of October. And we gather statistical figures, both of we have due the 7th of November. And we put-in a 36,000 and put-out is 42,000, and gross add is 62,000 and churn is 27,000. So, we did all the additions and subtractions, and net adds was 28,000. We have super bonus program and after subscribing to our service, two months is going to be free of charge period. So, in terms of the first and the second of each month, we have more customers subscribing to our service, as compared to other days. So, in term of the total months, net add is not 28,000 multiplied by 4. So, if you want to get the estimate for the monthly increase, if you just multiply 28,000 by 4, you will get two high a number. Nonetheless, if you go back to the previous chart, in October, we had about a week of MNP, and put-in is 31,000 and put-out is 55,000. That means that, put-out exceeded put-out by 20,000, as started in the 24, and so it was more than a week. We have some confusion at the very beginning. But nonetheless, the comparison of the two numbers is 31,000 to 55,000. And in November, it is 36,000, B2B 43,000. So, you'll see that the put-out number is decreasing as compared to October. And so, all-in-all, even though we see a put-out exceeding put-in, despite the fact that there was a confusion at the very beginning, you see improvements in the relationship between these two numbers. And there are people who do not mind changing their mobile number. But still, they want to switch to a new operator, and those people are included in gross adds of 52,000. So, amongst of the three carriers, if you want to see who won and who lost, it makes sense to look at put-in, put-out as gross adds and churn. So, you have to look at the total picture. So, mobile plus PC equals Softbank. We provide infrastructure portal and content. And we as a group actually support these four areas, and we try to pursue fund and inexpensiveness. And we try to enjoy the synergetic expect the PC and Mobile. And as far as profitability is concerned, average revenue per user will increase not only voice and data, but as a group we had different types of services as well as content. And I am sure that those practice will contribute in the increase of ARP. And we will like to create the new lifestyle of the 21st century. It's not that people enjoy the connection of broadband or mobile terminal, but we will like to have the community where people can really enjoy richness. We have SNS and streaming service with Yahoo! and Softbank. We have a TV Bank. And for the end users, it is introduced as Yahoo! Streaming Service. This Yahoo! video service \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the video service, all of the video service when they are added, it exceeds the service provided by USN [ph] or G service or Gal [ph] service, I am sure that know what that means, and I would just say that USN Gal and is indicated in blue. And the net rating, according to net ratings this is the result. The number of access from home, so this is not the number that we came up with but rather the third party net ratings. Gal is in blue and we are in orange here, and this is our graph. So, we are leading USN much more, so we are already number one in the video service. You know that to provide this video service we need the P2P Technology. You know that provide a step of making service so that we can improve the efficiency of the network. So this is the leading technology that we developed on our own and offer. So the load of the network can be controlled and cost can be reduced and performance can go up. That's why that the largest, for example, the base for video broadcasting at the high resolution and high picture quality, tens of thousands of people can watch it at the same time without creating or bottlenecking their networks. So we realized such multicast and probably this should be one of the Guinness Records, but that is based on our unique technology. And further the other day we announced that we will work with the largest Social Networking or SNS service, MySpace. com or News Corporation. News Corporation and Softbank will establish MySpace.com. And since last night we started a beta version and quickly we are seeing the number of the users increase. MySpace, the registered user is 125 million people. The increase per sec is 3.5. So compared to the increase of the population per sec, which is 2.5 per second, our increase is even \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for MySpace the increase is even higher than that number. Number of the registered users is increasing. And we'll be developing this service globally and into China or United States or Europe, I would like to grow this business so that we can provide a platform service and that's one of the major target to be a 21st century lifestyle company, that is our target. That concludes the results of the business. And I would like to entertain questions now.\",\n",
       " '2006 Q3': \"I am Mr. Son of SoftBank. Thank you very much. Last year -- in the middle of the last year, we have acquired Vodafone Japan. And starting from that point to October, mobile number portability, we have prepared several things. However, our customers have been expected to reduce by the mobile number portability by the competitors. That has been discussed. And we are also worried about that as well. But thanks for the situation, we have been able to still regain the customers. And yesterday we have disclosed the number of the customers. Profit-wise, originally mobile business is the profitable business from my understanding. And that has been reflected and contributed to our performance continuously. And those figures are going to be shared with you today. In highlight, last month that we have just announced the new pricing plan called White Plan and this has been well received steadily and migration from 2G to 3G has been accelerated. From the profit perspective, achieved the largest income since the foundation. And I'd like to go onto the detail. Slide four shows the breakdown. I would like to pick up each item by graph in the following pages. Page -- slide five shows the net sales, just a year ago, the first quarter to third quarter, comparing that figure, it has been twice as much or more that you can see from this graph. And we see in the past four years in the slide six. Four years, we've been making a steady growth. So from first quarter to third quarter we made 1.8 trillion Japanese Yen. And consolidated EBITDA, this is about four times as much. So, from first to third quarter, 94.9 to 382.4, so we can say this is four times as much. And the next is the operating income consolidated, last year same month -- same period, from 27.9 to 197.2, so it's about seven times as much growth that we have been experiencing. And ordinary income last year -- year-on-year was a negative 2.2 billion Yen, a negative figure, but this has been turned to positive figure, 111.6. So, we are making steady recovery. And our net income, we'll go into details later. But before tax profit against that, this is accounting perspective tax -- not the cash tax, but the tax from the accounting perspective is making here, mainly from the time difference and also the depreciation of the goodwill. That's not [indiscernible] as expense from the tax perspective. A non-operating income profit -- non-operating profit, excuse me. Second from the bottom, 40.4, you see the breakdown on your right hand side. This is the commission on Vodafone acquisition alone, which is 28.3. This is the one-off expense. Next year and the following -- this is not something to happening in next year and the following, so this is a one-off. In the one above, 28.9 annual basis, it's about 60 to 70 million are the expense related to the Vodafone acquisition in a full-year basis. And divided by four is the quarterly expense -- quarterly interest expense, and above that is the one-off expense of the accounting. Of course, other than Vodafone, SoftBank Group itself, the borrowing is there and that will be shown in the following pages. Next is the net income. Before tax, 176.9. Against that, tax related is quite high you may see, but in there, on your right hand side from the -- four from the bottom, 58.8 is coming from the tax provision for gain on sales of SBI shares. And this is the time difference. So, fourth quarter mostly coming back on fourth quarter. So, you can see this is the one-off end balance. So, performance-wise it's growing steadily. And slide 14, the summary of the consolidated earning results. In 15 and later, those are the graphs of the figure. Net sales growing steadily. The first quarter to -- starting from first quarter, e-commerce accounting for the profit has been changed, but the others are growing steadily. And page 16, EBITDA, 154 billion in quarter is the largest since its foundation, of course, and growing very steady basis. Operating income, slide 17. 84.7 billion, this is also largest since its foundation. Just a year ago or so, operating income already making a negative figure because of the advanced investment, but comparing that we're making quite a growth here. Page 18, mobile part, which is in a different color. Slide 19 is ordinary income. This too, making a steady growth. Net income as mentioned earlier, tax time difference and others happening. Operating cash flow 71.1 billion. This as well growing steadily. Operating income by segment in slide 22, as you can see in the slide. EBITDA page 23 and page 24 consolidated net income quarterly basis. Page 25, as mentioned a little bit earlier, mobile-related -- mobile relates to Vodafone acquisition, which is on your far right. Other than that -- which is green and the pink bar, is making steady reduction every year. And Vodafone acquisition finance -- refinance, which is 1.45 trillion Yen as a total for 3G and as disclosed before. And these are the financial institutions, which participated in this financing. Now, I think from page 28 and later is going to be more details on the mobile business. Page 28, on your left-hand side, the red bar are the performance in Vodafone -- former Vodafone. And since then, in gray bar, those are the performance after our acquisition. And you can see it's making steady growth. As mentioned, the one month net gain, net addition, 43%. Even though we look at -- look back the Vodafone era or J-Phone era, that this, I think the past 17 to 18 years, the one month net addition share of the 43% is the highest in the record. So we can say even after the mobile number portability, we're making good growth of our net addition. Slide 29 is the comparison with the competitors. The orange bar is the KDDI, blue is NTT DoCoMo, in the middle is us the SoftBank Mobile, each that are having up and down, but we are making good growth, as you can see from this graph. Page 30. The total users of our service, the pink colored one and the gray colored ones are the 2G and 3G users and you can see the surge of the 3G users here. Now, 3G ratio is 42% compared to other. This graph is a comparison with other operators. Next is the full commitment. During the course of growth of our Mobile Telecommunication business, at the timing of the acquisition, we announced we will commit to those four commitments. And the first one is the 3G-handset enrichment. You can see this graph on your material and this shows satisfaction on handsets. We conducted a questionnaire to customers. The light blue on the bottom, this is the satisfaction level in winter '04 to summer '05. As you can see, the satisfaction level is improved. And last year, design, function and easy to use and size, all the factors have shown better satisfaction. And the improvement of satisfaction is quite immediate. And we actually -- is the number one in terms of the size, the thickness and those also one seg. As for the one seg, last year in June we introduced this Cyclone-type handset, which was the first handset of this design in the industry. And the name is AQUOS model. And it has a record of the five consecutive number -- excuse me, number one in five consecutive months. And now we introduce AQUOS second model. And this actually had number one for two consecutive months, just like the first AQUOS model. So, in total, we have the number one of the one-seg model sales for seven consecutive months. So maybe you can say SoftBank Mobile is the number one in one-seg and we have kept that number-one position for long. And from the March on, we will introduce new handsets with higher specifications. This is a slide-type and we will have -- we will make it slimmer from a 27 to 22 millimeters and 17 millimeters. And this new model will have more functions. Next, I'd like to talk about the Slim model. Number one sales in Slim models is actually our 705SH Slimia. This was recorded last year in the summer. It's 17 millimeter thick and this is the slimmest in Japan. And it has number one sales in this field. And it is solely aimed for the world's slimmest. This is the shell type and 11.9 millimeters. And this is also a 3G handset. And that was introduced last fall. And this spring, we will introduce an 8.4 millimeter thick bar type, the world's slimmest once again model. And we are aiming for recovering the number one position in the world again. World's [ph] number one? Yes SoftBank Mobile. And slim number one, again SoftBank Mobile. And the next slide talks about the server evolution. We already announced the other day new handsets, please look at the video. Thank you very much. So, we are ready for releasing more and more new handsets in the spring. As a line up for this spring, we will -- we've already prepared 14 models with 58 color variations. Compared to the last year's line up for the spring, that was Vodafone time before our acquisition, again AU had ten models and DoCoMo had five models for the spring last year. And Vodafone Japan had four new models for the spring. That means they had the least variation of the models. But for this coming summer we will introduce 14 models. That is actually more than three times than before. And we are quite proud of this preparation in terms of the variation. And for the color variation, we had 11 color variations last year. But this year, actually we have 58 colors, that is more than or almost the equal sum of the competitors' color variation. So in terms of the color variation, for instance, if you go to the mass appliance retailers, the shop floor was rather dull and colorless and there was lack of the products to sell. And we have been improving that. So it's going to be colorful and fun with lots of functions and slim and [indiscernible] as number one. So, the first commitment we made, that is the line up of handsets improvement that is delivered as promised. We will exceed competitors and we will be comparable enough. That has been already delivered. The second commission -- commitment is enhancement of the sales structure and the branding. And we conducted -- various research conducted for the brand power. This is actually conducted by CM DataBank. Among the 4,398 commercial films, we actually achieved number one in November. And in December, out of 4,377 commercial films, we achieved number two. These commercial films include beer or home appliances, everything. And we achieved number one and number two among those commercial films. This had never been achieved by the Vodafone Japan before. And we are quite -- we are making a great effort into this field. And in November we have the [indiscernible] version and in December we had [indiscernible] featuring commercial shot in India. The next slide talks about significant improvement in retail presence. I believe this shop is at the camera shop of Yodobashi Camera, mass retailer shop. And you can see there is a crowd of people at the SoftBank corner. That is shown on the left. And on the right, I just wonder which shop this is. But it's another shop -- sales floor of mass retailer shop. So we are acquiring customers steadily. Mass appliance retailers is a field of fierce competition of three operators. We had some 10 and above percent in August last year. But now it's over 30%. So, in terms of the total sale, it's not about net gain because in terms of the market -- net gain and the market share comes in. So, this is actually the share that is rather more significant number than the net gain because the net gain growth is I think is rather big than what I explained. And so the sales at the carrier shops is impacted by the number of the shops. And we have less shops than other operators. But mass appliance retailers, they sell all of the operators and you can see the share of the mass appliance retailers, they have doubled the sales. And this is quite a good news to us. And also, we are taking more initiatives to make our customers happier. Expand SoftBank shops, try more to enhance supply and efficient shop operation. And also, the day after tomorrow actually, on February 10, Saturday of this week, I believe this is the largest sales floor shop of the mobile phone shop. And this will open in [indiscernible]. This will play a role of headquarter of SoftBank Mobile shop. Among the shops selling only mobile phones, this shop will be the largest kind. And at 11 O'clock on February 10, we will open it and please come to visit our shop. This is facing to the Ariyama [ph] Boulevard, which is heading to the [indiscernible] Sundome, and it has a wider span of the facade. And this is quite a fashionable building. Please come and have a look of it. And next, at our fashion show, which is called the Tokyo Girls Collection, and this is one of the biggest fashion shows in Japan. [indiscernible] quite a top fashion models. Actually I don't know of them very much. I just listed their names here. But those are quite popular fashion models will show up. In total 60 top models. And we will have the one model with the 70 -- excuse me, 20 color variations. This is going to be the world's first, I believe. And all of the 60 top models will carry our handsets on the stage in accordance with their outfit. So their outfit and our handsets will be coordinated. On 3rd of March, in Yokohama Arena, we will have this show. And also in the fall we will have the same kind of show. In the corporate sales, just a few days ago, we announced the option for the White Plan, which is the Double White. And this Double White is especially for the corporate customers. And also, other than corporate customers, those who use mobiles frequently they will -- our White option is going to be provided. So with that -- and also the handsets for the corporate users that we would like to enhance the corporate sales aggressively. And the pricing plan I've just mentioned, which is White Plan, which is very well received. A monthly fee of 980 Yen up until 9 o'clock at night, the voice airtime is free of charge amongst the SoftBank Mobile handsets, and to the other networks, 21 Yen per 20 seconds. Now, any captions anybody can understand. So our shop staff or for the customers we've been -- it has been taken very popularities -- very much popularities. Gold Plan, spending about three months and receiving 1.02 million publications. New customers 490K and also upgrade 530K. And so White Plan -- in three weeks we have exceed 1.05 million. So Gold Plan is 1 million in three months, White Plan 1 million in three weeks. Breakdown new customers, 210,000, upgrades 840,000. So, we've been accelerating the acquisition of customers to White Plan. White Plan, as mentioned, 980 Yen. So, we have a wider customers receiving well. And at the time of announcing White Plan, for sometimes the customers, the corporate users or the businessmen, probably not very good for the White Plan. I mentioned on our announcement so that later on. We, last month, we have announced the Double White, which is the most suitable customer -- most suitable for those customers who used handset mobiles frequently. And airtime after 9 o'clock or to the other networks 10.5 Yen per 30 seconds. 10.5 Yen actually is the -- our plan or our competitors, the monthly fee of 10,000 Yen or so -- spending or using about 11 years and also using the family discounts. And once that you've satisfied those conditions, after 11 years the 10,000 Yen will be reduced down to about 5,000 Yen which is the plan I just referred to. But the White Plan, 980 Yen, plus option Double White which is spending 900 Yen addition onto that. With that we are providing about the same level of airtime with just 10.5 Yen, equivalent to the competitors' plan which the monthly fee of about 10,000 Yen was after 11 years' usage. And between the SoftBank -- up until 9 o'clock at night it is free of charge. So, this is very good, well-structured price plan I believe. No, any captions. No small letters, very simple, easy to understand. Those new customers joining into SoftBank, more than 90% of those are joining to, subscribing to White Plan. The recent customers for about 90% were subscribing White Plan. So, from that sense, I believe that White Plan, one plan is suitable for almost everyone. So, easy to understand and simple, and making a good advantage to almost everyone. And adding onto that, White Plan will cover almost all customers who take an advantage. So White Plus, White Plan, then you don't need any other plan. And I don't think there is any other option you need to add to cover any other satisfaction level. So, for those heavy users, this is the good combination or the reasonable combination. So, you will be able to talk without minding time. And the slide 55 is the -- about introduction of handset installment sales net out. This is -- something that, typically, that in the Japanese way of selling, we are spending about 40,000 Yen per customer for the acquisition, which is not normal way of selling from my perspective. In that -- against that, we have questioned whether this traditional way is good or not, because spending about 40,000 Yen of sales incentive and three months later, or six months later or less than one year, those customers who upgrade their handsets is actually -- rather we are spending more to those customers. So, for that portion -- those many customers were spending more than two year or three year we -- if we apply the higher pricing plan to those customers which is not fair from our perspective, therefore we have adapted the general way of setting the handset which is installment in worldwide, so that we can make it rather fair, so that monthly fees was in the handset to be unbundled. That was our challenge, for this handset installment sales then we would be able to normalize the way of selling and at the same time we will be able to acquire the customers with longer periods. So the time of Vodafone, they have experienced a relatively high churn ratio. And if we simply sell the handsets with installment then that will be a further burden to the customer. But this time for those installment portions we made a special discount so that one month's total billed amount will be -- installment will be deducted from the one month billed, which is called -- which is so called the Super Bonus. This was a relatively difficult to explain in the beginning. But now that we -- and the transmitters now they have to explain to the customers as well which led us to the more net addition. With this sales method, we are able to lower the generation reward [ph] having a longer handset usage period, so that would give us a more stabilized management of the business. And the third commitment, 3G-network enhancement, if you cannot have an access it doesn't make any sense. So that, as promised, and since the last AGM [ph] that we have improved the 17%. And further we expanding that situation so we have said that the 46,000 base stations to be constructed, which was the commitment we made in the fourth quarter, which is by the end of next month in service base stations as you can see the dark blue bar. And adding on to that under the construction or property secured, those adding up to that, that we will exceed 46,000. Completion-wise, as mentioned from four months or five months before, in service-wise that the figure is going to be lower than 46,000. However, the construction in progress order property secured adding on to that then that the figure is going to be exceeding 46,000 as of the end of the fourth quarter. So the first half of the next fiscal year that we are planning to launch the more than 46,000 base stations. The light blue on top, which is property secured. To build a base station the most difficult part is to secure the property. Once you secure the property we can see that the 99% is almost finished for the base station construction process. So the most important and difficult part is property secured, but these ones that we are not on to that then we have further exceed 46,000 of the base stations. So not being on a 46,000 level, but we like to further extend. And the fourth commitment is the content enhancement. The plan of Vodafone Japan, customer number was the lowest so that the number of contents was lowest as well. So that was the situation Vodafone was experienced, but us because under our group company we have Yahoo. So Yahoo! Keitai was introduced. And we planned to provide a similar experience to PC or mobile phones so with one click you would be able to experience the same PC screen on your mobile phone. I am also using -- I am checking the share price because I am the OIT [ph] member for the Yahoo so that we are seeing the share price, whether as calendars in the real time. So I am using that everyday basis. But when it comes to the general customers, having the link to the Yahoo Japan was on the end of June. And back then we have number increased. And after that we make Yahoo! Keitai, which is October 1. And as of today, compared to the end of June, the page view was 45 times as much. So it is making a rapid growth. So having the Yahoo! Keitai made customers easier and more promoted of the usage. We have several companies under our group. So content for the service enhancement is going to be made. And number one streaming portal, which is Yahoo Streaming, is on target. This is also increasing the number of users. Net distributions. Distributing promotions over the Internet is also provided. You can see against the competitor company [indiscernible]. This is as shown indicated in green. And our Yahoo Japan streaming service is further higher than the green bar, 8.491 million research by the net rating Japan Inc access from homes. And the global challenge in China, in Europe or in US with our partners that we are developing. For example, in China, we have a joint venture with AliBaba 50/50. That is Taobao we have started to two years ago and this has Taobao has over 30 million users and exceeds Yahoo Japan's users. 30 million users might have already exceeded the number of the users of the eBay in the States, I'm not sure. But, as you can see here, the surge of the number of users is quite extraordinary. And the line up of the products on auction is quite big. And also the payment online in the Internet also has a 70 or 80% value acquired over rolling share. And the next one is Alibaba. It also has overwhelming number one position in the field of B2B. So we are quite active in China at last. Our revenue source at the present is infrastructure portal and the contents. There are three layers. But in the future we will see the importance of the content within your resource so that should be growing. As a conclusion we will make mobile phone in Japan more fun. We will make broadband in Japan more fun. That is SoftBank. And SoftBank is aiming to become a company that can be called a lifestyle company in the 21st century. That is all from me for the announcement of earning results for the third quarter.\",\n",
       " '2006 Q4': 'I am Son from SoftBank.Thank you very much for today.There are several turning points in your lifetime and the same thing happens to the company as well.For SoftBank start to be involved in the internet business was one of the biggest turning point, and also start Yahoo BB business to build the internet environment to make the speed faster.That\\'s another turning point and this time we have acquired Vodafone KK last April for the mobile phone operation and this is actually another one of the biggest turning points for the future SoftBank.So we include the [indiscernible] operation as one of the domains of the business and if we without this domain looking back 10 years or 20 years, I think the difference is going to be much bigger. So last April we actually acquired this company.In the same time as the announcement share price of the SoftBank actually decreased.Looking back the past at the time we announced we just launched the Yahoo BB actually share price went down as well when before when we launched the internet business together with Yahoo and E-trade and some other Internet business.We had our first big drop of share price of our company.So every time we experience a turning point, every time we announced a launch of big business we had our share price down, and after then when we come back the normal situation then we recover our share prices.So we have repeating same type of the history.In that 1 year has passed since then of the acquisition of Vodafone and was the Vodafone KK buy acquisition a success?And now, answer is yes. In the concerns before acquisition what was those?And basically we had four points.One was the funding.Were we able to finance the debtors and the profitability because we were facing the mobile number ability and are we going to be able to increase the customer base?And thirdly our users, number of customers.Is it going to be right?And the brand.For the consumer\\'s business the brand of SoftBank, is it going to be accepted by the consumers?Those four were the biggest concern we had before the acquisition.And coming back to the first concerns, the funding.We had completed the refinancing of 1.45 trillion.As a result 1.7 trillion acquisition finance was able to make.And also profitability.Compared to the Vodafone KK period to operating proper income.It gained 1.8 times as much so after the acquisition there are some concerns that operating income is going to go negative. But last year we were able to bring a farther positive figure in the number of customers, actually that we made 4 times of annual net additions compared to the previous year. Even though we had experienced the biggest risk which was mobile number profitability but we were able to exceed and further increase our customer base. And lastly, the brand strength that the weight and the touch display the one with the slice.Third party the TV commercials research institute after they showed amongst the old TV commercials including food, mass appliances, in all the industries, actually our TV commercials of SoftBank. From October to December and from January to March we ran a number preferred TV commercial. So with those 4 points we need that we made a very good start.So still with those starting points that we are fitting right now, but I believe that this start was very well going. Now, I would like to go into the details of the consolidated earnings results 2.5 trillion of net sales, the previous term was $1.1, so it is actually more than twice.EBITDA 525 billion, in previous year it was 149 or 150, so it\\'s about three times as much.Operating income 271 billion, ordinary income 153 billion, income before income taxes in minority interest 200 billion, net income 28 billion. Looking back the five years as you see in Slide 7, we\\'re making a very good and steady increase of the net sales.In the recent two years, the net sales by segment are on Page 8.Also the EBITDA is very close to the actual operating cash flow 525 billion, which is also making a very good turning over in the biggest ever of it\\'s foundation, so three times as much on a year on year basis.And by segment, the EBITDA Page 10 in all the segments making a bigger result on year on year.Consolidated operating income, is to, making a turning round, and again biggest ever since it\\'s foundation of 271 billion yen.Operating income by segment, again in all segments, we made a better performance. As mentioned earlier, when we only look into the SoftBank mobile, the mobile operations, we made 134 billion of operating income compared to 76 billion in the previous year.So that it reaches 1.8 times as much.Consolidated ordinary income 153, a few years ago was about 45 billion in negative when the biggest negative term was 2002 of 190 billion, and at this time recording 153 billion.Consolidated net income, as you see on Slide 15 we have some gains of the share sales, and we had tax and some other adjustments on Page 16.So 48 billion for the income taxes, which doesn\\'t have any cash outflow for this term, in other words we can say the deferred tax, which is 93 billion.And because we are running the conservative accounting as a tax asset we have the unrecognized deferred tax assets with 317 billion you can see on your right hand side up above on page 16, we believe that had which lead to her business still experiencing negative when those turn in to positive then we will be able to utilize those in that time that we will be able to see this recognized.So this hasn\\'t been accrued as an asset yet. Net interest bearing debt on page 17, except for the Vodafone acquisition we are reducing the interest bearing debt by 100 billion each. Cash position 300 billion or so, so we have enough in efficient cash and cash equivalent. Acquisition of Vodafone KK.After the announcement of acquisition of Vodafone KK each rating agencies consider the downgrading, but as a result actually they upgrade the rating.Some of them have upgraded the rating, so even from the rating agency\\'s point of view that this acquisition was very healthy transaction. And as mentioned in the beginning when we start the new business stock price once went down but after then together with the smooth progress of the business stock price recovers along with that. So after the acquisition of Vodafone KK we made a dramatic start.I\\'m not going to read each of them but there are several promotions and also activities we have done.At the time of the acquisition our customer base was 15 million and now that\\'s exceeding 16 million and making a more customer base additionally.And from April 2006 was 12 months but we were able to gain 850 thousand net additions. Another way that we were thinking to enter into the mobile operational business, even without the acquisitions of Vodafone KK.But suppose we didn\\'t acquire Vodafone KK then the start of probably 5 to 10 years in the beginning we should have experienced the negative position if we start from scratch in the mobile operation.And we should have gone through a very difficult time to make the operation start, just like we experienced in the \\'80s with our business.So if that hadn\\'t been the option we took then that would have been more difficult.Therefore our decision is now proved very right and I\\'m very confident in that.Thirdly, at the time when it was thought upon last year, two years ago, it was just 30 thousand customers from the addition and 22 thousand in the following year so it was very stagnant when it comes to the net addition, but now for the last 12 months we acquired 850 thousand net additions. And tomorrow we are going to make official announcement but last month April, the net gain is over 167 thousand.Prepaid users do not give us much revenue excluding those smaller per customers.The post paid customers actually increased by 200 thousand.This is the hugest net gain since the Vodafone time.In the cumulative subscribers over 16 million, and 3G subscriber\\'s ratio is over 50%.3G customers bring us more revenue and user for the year 4 months after the introduction rate plan, now 4 million and over customers are on this plan.This graph shows months remaining at addition.As I just mentioned, even when it was a Vodafone time, you can see those are x bars.These are the situation that Vodafone KK faced, and as you can see, it was the segment.And the bars in gray are the SoftBank results And we achieved over 160,000 at the last month.So you can see the trend has changed in favor. And the next page talks about the net addition, excluding pre-paid customers.So when it was Vodafone KK, excluding pre-paid, there were no months with more than 100,000 net addition, but when it became SoftBank Mobile, or when it was acquired by SoftBank, last month actually, we had over 200,000 net additions.So you can see the huge difference from the Vodafone time and this is the biggest improvement we made.In 2G customers do not give us much revenue, but synergy does.That\\'s what I mentioned, and you can now see the ratio this really uses a month against the customer base is growing, and the churn rate of the 3G users. Fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006, the Vodafone time and you can see the churn rate is quite bad.So even when they acquired customers, they just lose.And the market expected that the churn rate would surge because of the member possibility.And that was the idea when we wrote Vodafone KK and even after the acquisition of Vodafone KK by SoftBank, up to the member portability introduction in October, the market speculated that we would lose about 30% of that customer base.That would be critical to us if that happened.And the market and also the press media has that sentiment, and many of the analysts strongly shared that sentiment. However in reality, after it became SoftBank Mobile, the 3G churn rate has been improved greatly.And this is not just a temporary improvement, but we changed the structure of sale by introducing installment sale.That gives us the customers\\' commitment for the coming 2 years.And that means a longer time of explanation for us to gain customers\\' understanding, but even with those hardships, we wanted to reduce 3G churn rate or overall churn rate.Therefore, we changed that sales method.And we now have the highest number of the net addition.Therefore, the content of management and sales and the structure has been changed in favor and it\\'s better than it looks.When compared to last year, the 3G base stations now account for a month for 31,000, compared to the 21,000 1 year ago.And network satisfaction has improved by 26% due to that base station construction. And as for the handsets, the variety of color with the variety of models were rather poor, but compared to 1 year ago, now we have a 3.3 times more varieties of models and also 3.9 times more variety of colors.And also TV commercial preference is number 1 in the country. And as for that management change, -- the sales structure changed we introduced on installment sale and 80% of the customers opted to purchase the handsets through this method.And we introduced Yahoo button, and now you see the 53 times more accesses to the Yahoo KK [ph] webpage. I just mentioned several things, so let me start with the 3G network base station.We are planning to achieve the 46,000 base stations interest he first half of this year.We have already acquired the land, and we already completed the construction and some of the base stations are already in activation.So counting those base stations under construction, we already have 46,000.So it\\'s just a matter of time to see the numbers before base stations weak promised will be in operation.And as a result of what I just mentioned a moment ago, the satisfaction of the 3G network was improved by 26%. And this is handset.One year ago there were only 19 type models but now we have 35 models so it\\'s almost doubled in number.For the second half you can see the number of the variety was more than tripled so if we compare the second half then the 12 models in the second half of last year but now we have 39 models.So the first half we introduced the handsets which were developed by Vodafone KK, but 39 models these are the ones we developed and released.And the other companies has the 20 models, 20 and also 24 models therefore we exceeded them.And also in terms of the variety of the colors we increased these dramatically.Now we have 120 which is more than double \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or almost double compared to the other companies.And after those efforts, design and operability and easy to use and size those are all improved and the score is doubled.So our handsets are chosen by the customers.Customer likes our handset.When it was Vodafone the handset was bulky and there were no big choice but those problems are solved and improved.And especially for Onesag [ph] handset we have the 5 month enroll number one and that is of course number one model and that was actually number 1 in sales among all the handsets.And also among of course handsets it was number one for the 3 months in consecutive.And the slim models, we actually set up a new trend in Japan and it became number 1.And as for the fashionable handset 20 colors per 1 model was introduced and this is the world\\'s number 1 actually so we set up a new trend for fashion in handsets as well.And generally customers now understand \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, generally SoftBank was ranked as third for the operators with the biggest varieties and AU was number 1.But it was in March we became number 1.So just for the 3 month the perception of the users has been changed.This is quite rare.This is actually based on the third party institution research.And as for the brand image we actually racked up the total meet time with our advertisement and there is already run a variety of the TV commercials.And as a result the TV commercial preference on the second is Suntree [ph] and third Nintendo and fourth Tokyo Gas and the fifth Japan Coca Cola and sixth Toyota.Those companies are famous and huge.And TDDI is ranked seventh and Matsoshito Komo [ph] is ranked at fifteenth.And now we are now number 1 and this research was done from the October to December.And also from January to March we again achieved number 1.So we achieved number 1 for 2 months in a row.And SoftBank used to be a rather unknown company to general consumers but now the nation recognizes our company.This CM research center people just mentioned this is just like a miracle.Just for your information which TV commercial was preferred by consumers?And this is a non aided consideration so consumers are asked to fill in a form to list up TV commercials they remember and that they like.Therefore you have to have big exposure.And the number of the TV commercial runs was biggest for AU and we are at 29%.And you can see the trend for the last 3 years, 12%, 27% and now 29%.But for the unaided consideration of TV commercial the cumulative share is actually from 8 to 21% and then now it\\'s 50% after Vodafone KK became SoftBank Mobile.When it was Vodafone KK it was at 21%.Two years ago AU had over 50% preference and it was number 1 among the 3 operators.So first they achieved a good preference among the consumers, and then they encouraged the consumers to buy their services.That is our assumption and hypothesis about the AU\\'s success.And now you can see 50% is the preference answer.So we actually by ourselves alone believe this might be a good sign, but this is just our own guess and speculation. And this is just not about this preference. So when you like it and then you have an appetite you use, but actually, that\\'s something that goes along with the preference.So you first come to like it, and then that you like to try out, and even with this, we have hit 47%.So it is very interesting data that we\\'re seeing here. So back in Vodafone, net addition was very poor, but after the condition we sowing the growth, as you can see from this graph.So we\\'ve been also enhancing the sales activities together with mass appliance retailers, Softbank shop and non-exclusive shops and the corporate customs.We have several activities to each signal, especially in the mass appliance retailers.We actually report highest net additions share in total back in Vodafone at the mass appliance retailer that performance was very poor, but then but after that position, even in the same setting booth, together with AU and Docomo [ph], but the customer is now choosing SoftBank.The ratio of that choice is now becoming higher.So we have more and more customers choosing SoftBank than you see the same corners are selling the Docomo [ph] and AU. And to improve the churn ratio and also to reduce the upgrades in short term like 3 months or 5 months, for those customers, actually we\\'re experiencing the negative performance, not only us but also the competitors.But for those customers, we actually ask them to commit to our network for 2 years with the installment sales.In the monthly payments for the installment, actually our customers will be able to enjoy some special discounts from the monthly fee, and that is the so-called new signup bonus.And that scheme is well received and going smoothly.So this is going to change the management route to the better direction.And we started existing trial period and going very well received, which leads us to the lower churn ratio and that also leads to the better revenue in the future, which is very happy news for us. In this scheme, was actually discussed at the Mobile Communications Study Group at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications as an agenda to improve the situations for the subsidies.And for the customers perspective that it\\'s very difficult to use, and also the new scheme the NVNO.So with this new study group called Mobile Communications Study Group, we\\'re actually taking ahead of it and taking a lead on up the way of the business model itself in the mobile market.AS a result of the installment sale, we were able to reduce those negative customers and increase the positive customers, which will be our revenue source, and those revenue sources we like to return to the customer, which comes to White [ph] plan. So up until 9:00 at night, we made all net calls free of charge between SoftBank Mobile and also 21 yen per 30 seconds, which is the same price with the competitors or cheaper.In the free of charge portion, up until 9:00 between SoftBank Mobile is still completely free of charge and on top of that for those calls to the other networks we made it half of the price.So in those two competitors, 10.5 yen per 30 seconds, which is equivalent to L Plan or LL Plan but those cases usually the customer require to pay 10,000 yen or so as a monthly charge.But our case only 900 yen on top of the 900 yen -- 80 yen of the White plan.So with this reasonable monthly fee that this reasonable air time is realized.And again completely free of charge of the call between SoftBank mobiles and until 9:00 at night, and also the messaging between SoftBank mobiles.So we stick to our present plan we were able to exceed 4 million customers joining to this White plan.And they going very well. So the image of the pricing plan of the company actually -- excuse me, when we ask the customers which company\\'s pricing plan is more reasonable enough of the AU was mostly well received but the latest survey by the third party shows that SoftBank actually recognized as the most reasonable pricing plan providing operator.So to get the image of getting ahead of time that we were able to improve drastically since last September, like ahead of time, unique flexibilities, interesting, energetic, those five items or elements, in all those elements we were able to improve largely. And our business roadmap, so currently that we be seeing us as an initial stage.Next step is going to be the growth stage and then the hardest stage so we making very good progress and as scheduled.And at the same time we made a repayment of the financing along -- which came from the opposition.So networks, content, handset and sales branding, those four commitments to be improved steadily and going forward. When it comes to the group synergy, network efficiency, customer best leverage, content expansion, sales structure, and enhancement, so Yahoo BB, SoftBank Telecom, which is the Four MagicPan Telecom, and Mobile, those three communication companies to make it one synergy group and also several internet content and service company including Yahoo Japan to make our business further proactive. When it comes to the network that in the past SoftBank BB, SoftBank Telecom, SoftBank was in each separate but in a few years, or within two, three years we would like to make a completely of the integration of the network.And by doing so we will be able to expand on network capacity in a much higher speed with -- and also reduce the operational costs, which we\\'ll be able to provide the more reasonable service to the customers. And handset, on 22nd of May, this month that I am going to make an announcement and we\\'re going to have announcement meeting in ARPU.And then on this month we see strategy.We would like to increase more services so that that\\'s going to contribute to the ARPU increase.At the time of the Yahoo BB launch that was 2,700 yen of the ARPU and now we are experiencing a 4,300 yen of the ARPU.It is almost twice as much.And that is because of the several additional service fees, and because of those value-added service that led to the additional ARPU.So without the customers\\' support we will not be able to increase the ARPU.But we have actually experienced the success of the ARPU increase or improvement at the time of Yahoo BB so that we believe that we will be able to increase the opportunities for the revenue and at the same time to run a healthy management. One of the approach we made for the Yahoo BB ARPU improvement was Yahoo Auction.Auction items increased along with the time goals and the Yahoo! button that we made it to our Kate [ph] mobiles and access compared to the end of June that it became 50-times more.Last July we first made -- put the link to Yahoo! Japan and in October we made Yahoo! button so with those two steps we were able to increase the number of access dramatically.And access is going very well, managed and as a result we were recognized as the company very strong with the internet. Last October, at the time that we were third position for the number of colors, number of handset models but again the internet -- image for the internet service we now recording the first positions compared to the competitor.So not only are we in a type of uphill that makes us as a first position, but not only that content, handset, and also with several sales activities we are making further enhancement of our managements.So as a result the continuous use intention is increasing but then with 72% customers have an intention to continuously use.But that increased to 77% but in February 2006 72% but in October last year I think it was 60% or so.So we experienced a decline once in October and then come back to -- came back to 77%.So not a kind of flat increase but we experienced a decline once and recovered from that to 77%. From that sense I think our efforts and the points improved has been well received by the customers.So we have several internet companies, content companies and service companies in our group.So mobile not only for the voice calls but it\\'s changing to the two, to enjoy the several contents.So from the voice machine to data machine when it comes to that period SoftBank because we have a very strong with internet we will be able to enhance our position for the higher.So that era is coming very close.So in the area of the baseball, top or bottom way of saying even in the same game that we have top and bottom.But we have in this internet era I think we are in the active position towards the second stage. And infrastructure, content, portals, are in SoftBank arenas.And just for your information in the Internet dwells we have streaming service.It says, \"New companies serves G,\" and maybe you can have a good guess.[indiscernible] a month is 8,924,000.That means there is a no-resemblance calculation.There are no redundant counting.It\\'s not the total.That the one user will be just counted as one, even he uses the services so many times a month.So this is a very conservative way to count but still this service has the 8,924,000 and this is already proved by our third party neutral position institution.So in the internet streaming service we are number one again.SoftBank holds this one thing as a content representing Tibo Rote Nippon Ham Fighters [ph].Those baseball games distributed live on the internet.This is just one of the many examples.And there is in Korea and in France we have broadcast stations which run videos with our technology.And then we are expanding our foothold. And the IPO result for the last several years, you can see there are so many different companies we invested in, and many of them went public.And this year, ITMedia just recently went public.In Japan and overseas, we expect more than one company will go public and they are preparing now for IPO.And 2 years ago, we started investing in internet-related companies.And now it\\'s again we are at the harvest period.Infrastructure portal and content so actually we\\'d like to reverse that side or the reliance and we\\'d like to use our collective force number one internet group.That is what we are aiming for.And you can see many companies on the chart. Actually this morning at our Board of Directors meeting, we are discussing about the annual general meeting next month, and we are discussing about election of a new director.And in China, we have a group company called Alibaba and Toubou [ph].And CEOs of those two companies, Mr. Jack Mar [ph], will be welcomed to the Board of Directors of SoftBank.And this is going to be brought up to the next annual general meeting of shareholders and that will be held next month.And that was resolved at the meeting of the Board of Directors of SoftBank this morning.So representing the country of China, Mr. Jack Mar [ph] will join us.And from the United States, Mr. Juan Fisher [ph] and Mr. Mark Schwartz [ph] are already on the board.So in addition to the United States, we expect China will become a very important venue for us.Alibaba already enjoys its overwhelming number 1 position in China.And as a C2C auction, just like a Yahoo Japan auction in Japan, that service his company already achieved an overwhelming number 1 position.Therefore, B2B number 1 and C2C number 1 positions.And also using internet hey have a payment service, and again in this field they are number 1.And that is overwhelming number 1, again.So in China we have a very favorable trend of business.And we will welcome Mr. Jack Mar [ph] to join on our Board of Directors. So the ways to use mobile phone which are not expected to be achieved are actually in the pipeline of our initiatives.And we\\'d like to make mobile in Japan more fun.And also we\\'d like to make broadband in Japan more fun.And we are aiming to become the number 1 internet company life style company in the 21st century, that is what SoftBank aims for.And we use that to contribute to the general public and the society.Thank you very much. ',\n",
       " '2007 Q2': 'I\\'m Son of SoftBank Corp. Today we have very happy news to break. A moment ago our Strategic Group Company in China, Alibaba was listed in Hong Kong market. The offering was -- in total was about 1 trillion yen, but at the moment the market value is 2.8 trillion yen in total. About six years ago when it was just a short time after the Alibaba started SoftBank decided to invest in that company and it was about 2 billion yen and 30-something percent of the shares -- stake in that company was held by SoftBank Corp. And now it\\'s just 2.8 trillion yen and just for the B-to-B business. Well, have also added certain investment afterwards but the first 2 billion yen gave us the 30-some percent of stake in that company. China is a vast country and the number of users is much greater than that of Yahoo! Japan even only for B-to-B when you look at the Alibaba\\'s customers. And Taobao, that is a kind of equivalent to Yahoo! Auctions in Japan, and the holding proportion is 50 to 50 and that is a joint venture we\\'ve started with Alibaba five years ago. And that auction portion only, for instance for the items sold on that site is 10 times more than the Yahoo! Japan\\'s. So the market is still holding a great potential and it\\'s also growing so rapidly. I will talk about it more later. But now, once again we realize that as an internet company SoftBank Corp has been taking every effort in terms of its strategies to expand our footprint in China and Japan and Asia, and those are now materializing. SoftBank is number three player in Japanese mobile phone market but SoftBank is the internet number one company in Asia and that just has started mobile phone business. That is how we see our business and how we would like the market to look at us. Let me go to the presentation. First I\\'d like to start with the highlights. This is saying the operating income increased by 49% and the net income 3.2 times BIBA, and so the net subscriber ads was 1.143 million, and I just mentioned the Alibaba. It\\'s made the IPO successfully in Hong Kong so those three are the highlights. And let me take you to the detailed numbers. Net sales, EBITDA, operating income, ordinary income, income before income taxes and the minor changes, and the net income, all of them have the record high. The core business of ours, the Mobile Phone business, a year ago in the first half it was 97,000 and the DoCoMo had 960,000; therefore it was like a one-tenth. But this first year, now we have the 10 times more net adds and DoCoMo has one-third of net adds and KD has almost flat net adds compared to the last year. So at the timing we acquired Vodafone Japan, and that was just before number portability had started, and many experts just expected that SoftBank would lose about 1 million customers, and we had a certain feeling or anxiety that, that would -- might be true. But we conducted some research then existing customers actually answered that one-third of the existing customers wanted to use MNP to switch operators. So the decrease of customers by 1 million was kind of normal and objective outlook on SoftBank Mobile\\'s customer growth. But that was not acceptable to us; therefore we made every effort and then -- now we have the 10-times bigger net gain year-on-year and to get more customers than if we lose profit then that\\'s nonsense. Therefore, we also tried to improve the profit and as a result we had an increase of 49% year-on-year. And comparing with two other operators we have increased by 49% year-on-year in terms of the operating income, KDDI 9% increase and DoCoMo negative 21%. And so as you can see the consolidated net sales trend on Page nine and by segment here. So our acquisition of the mobile phone operation was quite a good decision. EBITDA, this is kind of equivalent to the operating cash flow before the amortization and the goodwill and interest payment but in US and Europe this EBITDA is more -- considered more important than operating income. And EBITDA is also moving very well and that was 800-and-some billion yen so this is quite healthy for the last three years. Operating income, just two years ago our operating income was just 4.4 billion yen but two years ago we just had 4.4 billion yen; now I realize that. And by segment we had just bought Japan Telecom and it had a great negative as our investment -- primitive investment, and broadband at that time was about to go through the great red figure. So in substance we had a great struggle at that moment. Just for your information the stock price, at the moment SoftBank\\'s market value is almost equal to that of the two years ago when we only had this 4.4 billion yen. From 4.4 billion yen, that is a half-year amount, it\\'s now improved to167.7 yen billion and we have a very successful Mobile Telephone business. And two years ago Alibaba was -- didn\\'t have any rumor about IPO but today it successful made IPO so all those business in negative figures are now in positive. So the -- two years ago and today if you compare the price over the shares of SoftBank, it\\'s almost same but the business has been improved greatly. Two years ago we had a negative ordinary income 1.34 billion yen negative, and this year 77% increase year-on-year and we have about 100 billion yen just for the first half of the year. And the net income, that is also increased, and it\\'s 3.2 times more year-on-year and two years ago it was also negative. And those details from other income to net income are shown on this table. Income and other \\xe2\\x80\\x93 income taxes and minority interest those are things that are also included in this table. And the cash flow has been improved as well. The installment receivables increased, it says here174.3 billion yen, and the proceeds from securitization of this installment receivables here says 153 billion yen, and those are on balance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of this side installment receivables is on balance and we made this securitization. So this 153 billion yen can be considered as the operating cash flow that we will show you a situation closer to the actual. So about 153 billion yen black figure should be included in the operating cash flow. That will show you the real status of our company but the accounting should be conservative; therefore we have this process for accounting sake. And the cash position, it\\'s a little bit less then 500 billion yen and we have about 120 billion yen of the unused portion of the credit line facility, and these are quite a fluent cash position, and we do not have any worries about it. And the next page talks about the net interest bearing debt. To start the Mobile Phone business we needed funds to acquire Vodafone Japan operations, and that is shown in grey and red on this table. And other than the mobile phone operation, for the last three years we have been decreasing the net interest bearing debt by 100 billion yen so the balance sheet is improving in a quite healthy way. And it\\'s up 6.6% to 7.9%. That is equity ratio following the accounting standards. But if you look at \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you would like to look at the actual situation of SoftBank Group, for instance the Yahoo! Japan\\'s and this Alibaba.com, those are the Group Companies we have stake in, and if we import them into our equity not like following the standards of accounting but if you\\'d like to look at the actual status then that could be done as one of the exercises to look at the actual status, then it\\'s about a 26.2%. This is of course not accounting standards applicable. Therefore this 7.9% of equity ratio, this is the accounting standard compliant. But I think instead of the properties or the real estate but the financial potential or unrealized gain should be also included in the equity. And the next is the Mobile Communications business. As mentioned earlier we have some fears before back then at the time of acquisition but actually in reality that it turns out that we gained number one net addition share for five consecutive months, and our net addition share is already taking about 50% of the market share as of September 2007, in October as well that we\\'ve been keeping difficult trends. And tomorrow we will have an official announcement for the net additions for October month. In October again compared to the competitors we believe that we keeping this momentum. That\\'s what we expect so far. And when we see it by semi-annual basis compared to two years before it was a negative share actually. Last year it was a one digit a share, and this has been turned into double digits. And actually that we taking a position from KDDI and DoCoMo. KDDI lost a little bit and DoCoMo had a steep decline in the half -- excuse me, instead of that, that SoftBank gained those portions. And next is the 3G ratio, 3G customers\\' ratio. We be reaching 64%. Of course compared to 2G, 3G customers are better off from the business point-of-view and that\\'s what we\\'ve seen that we\\'re having a good and smooth migration from 2G to 3G, and this exceeded 10 million for 3G customers. In the next 50 base stations because we had to have a connectivities amongst the nations and we have 47,000 and installed at the base stations so we have about three times as much as they use these stations as we promised before when we have completed those constructions. And those base stations are now in service. Compared to last year\\'s situation it was about twice as much. So 3G\\'s mobiles these days we believe network connectivity satisfaction has been dramatically improved and that is because we\\'ve been making every effort to expand the base stations\\' spending this past year. In the penetration of installment sales we have started our installment sales scheme. Back in a year ago we\\'d been making a comment that this is not a good idea to mixing the subsidy and airtime so that is why that we have decided to launch the installment program for the handset sales. And this has been actually criticized by the competitors and also in the mass media our price made it further difficult to understand. That kind of pointed out was also made, however actually study group of ministries DoCoMo NAU discussed, and it\\'s rather right of the business model that the separating has a price in the airtime. So we have already exceeded 8 million subscribers for the installment program and it\\'s also showing a good trend. Price plan, because there are too many pricing plans for the customers and the customer never knows that which one is the suitable -- most suitable for them if you speak so much time then which of the price plans will be the best, or how much discount are you going to be enjoy, or what kind of discount options are there available. Those kinds of things all are making it complicated for the market so seeing that situation we decided to make it very simple, which is White Plan and Double White Plan. So currently close to 97 to 98% of the customer or of the consumers who are newly joining into SoftBank\\'s network are choosing either White Plan or the Double White. So because this is very simple and also easy to understand pricing plan that\\'s why that\\'s being well received. As a result of this satisfaction in pricing we\\'ve been able to win the number one position for the satisfaction in pricing. On top of that, TV commercials preference as well, we\\'ve been able to gain the triple winning for three consecutive months. Right after the MNP we had been criticized that our TV commercial is misleading or giving some misunderstanding so by the Fair Trade Commission that we\\'ve been pointed out on that, and we\\'ve been studied and also learned from that. We tried to make it simple for the pricing plan as well as the TV commercials for the market. So with our efforts onto that we\\'ve been able to won the triple wining with the three consecutive months, which is the first thing ever. Actually we did in last November ourselves so looking the 12-month period we gained this position for four times. So actually that what we done is the three months consecutively is the first ever. So by company, by TV commercials, by brands, is those three items, which is most important we were able to win over amongst the companies. There are about 4,500 TV commercials with 3,185 brands. We took number one positions for three consecutive months. Moreover sales channels that we\\'ve been working on because at the time of MNP that we had to have no choice but let customer wait for about one hour or two hours for the registration. So we learned from that and we expanded the number of shops, right now 2,417 shops as of the end of September, which is increased by 30%. At the time of acquisition of Vodafone one-third of the shops were in negative so they wished to close the shop actually. That was the survey result, which was really critical situation but currently most of the shops are turning into positive figures and they rather like to increase their shops. So we like to have a good plan too, and also have a good management on the increase of the shops \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the number of shops. And the registration counter in the shop increased by 63% and currently that we exceeded 10,000 counters; as a result that the waiting time has been improved dramatically so that the customer will be able to have a smooth operations for the registration. And because we did have an acquisition of Japan Telecom, with that this has been making a good contributions for the acquisition of corporate customers, and the number of corporate customer acquisitions compared to last year has been increased by 5.5 times as much. And White Plan Family Discount 24 has launched and we\\'re selling that promotion. With that -- but then it was about 40% of the penetration but has been increased to 70%. So only a few months that we\\'ve been able to turn this 40% into 70%, which is very rare I believe. And last year brand recognition has dropped because of some confusion but we have been able to improve the intention to continue use of SoftBank. As a result churn ratio back then was more than 3% and now that we\\'ve been able to bring down to 1.05%. And the trend of ARPU, this is the Average Revenue Per User as you see on this slide. If you take a look closely with this instruction from ministry, if we -- because this time with this instruction that we have to separate the handset price and airtime but we actually had a step advanced compared to the competitors and the installment plan has been launched before our competitors started. So the ARPU is shown separately. Accounting procedure-wise this installment, a portion needs to be taken out from the ARPU definition. But back then that ARPU was handset subsidy, the discounted portion has been putted on to the airtime but this time that we start charge, the handset price itself when we started we discount the airtime. So as long as we separating that, that it is natural to see \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to do the comparison apple-to-apple if we combine those two together. So from that sense as the prize customers paying for us doesn\\'t total this, combined together with voice data and the installment. It\\'s shown in this slide and you see that the ARPU is not declining from that interpretation. And in future, what\\'s going next? From 2G to 3G, as you see that we migrating rapidly, the customer is changing or they\\'re migrating from 2G to 3G but when it comes to 3G to 4G we believe that we going to increase the data revenue from the customer. In few years later the 4G\\'s era coming in and basically we believe that the voice-oriented is going to be changed to data-oriented use of the mobile, which means mobile is not for the voice tools but it\\'s going to be changed to internet machine. So from voice machine to internet machine that we are seeing the transition of the mobile so 2G to 3G towards 4G, this tendency is much accelerated, we believe. So we believe we need to make our handset more strong over internet for the coming period, and we have released many models, and I\\'d like to show you a two or three-minute video footage. [Video] Premium quality. [Japanese] Premium lineup and more. [Japanese] New service. [Japanese] Thank you very much. There we have seen we have quite a rich line up of mobile phones and I am actually using this model for the last two weeks. I really wanted to make the mobile slim but also when you have a slim model it\\'s rather difficult in terms of the operability of the keys. But we made efforts and this is quite a good keypad, and you can have a friendly operation. And this is like a one step model for grown ups, and I love this. I love the texture. I\\'m just I\\'m using this test model and evaluating with the customers\\' point of view. If you just have a look at this then you really want to get it. As I just mentioned, the Alibaba, this company was listed as of the [inaudible] 2.9 trillion yen of the market capitalization so that is the closing figure of today. We had initial offer over 1 trillion yen but as a result we have the 2.9 trillion yen at the end of the day. And Alibaba plus Yahoo! Japan, those two are equal to number one internet company in Asia. Alibaba plus Yahoo! Japan is equal to number one internet company in Asia. And that also equal to SoftBank. As I just mentioned 1 trillion yen was the initial offering but it\\'s now 2.9 trillion yen. And now we are working with Alibaba for the finalizing. It\\'s about the Alibaba Japan; that is a joint venture and SoftBank would like to have a majority stake in it and Alibaba Japan as a joint venture is in pipeline. Yahoo! or e-Trade and other business models that were successful in Japan -- excuse me, in the States have been brought to Japan by us and those are successful. And other businesses are also introduced to Japan from other countries and Alibaba has the most advanced business model in the world in terms of B-2-B business, and that is going to be brought into Japanese market. That is something we are working on at the moment. In SoftBank, just some time ago it was speculated as just a investment group, not a operating company and we had some news of that rumor. Investment funds and SoftBank have differences. For instance investment funds just invest like 2 or 3% and they do not influence the management, and they do not actively involved in the management so it\\'s a passive investment. But as for the SoftBank\\'s case usually it\\'s around 30% or sometimes 40% of a stake in a country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a company, and when it is in Japan we usually go for majority stake so it\\'s a strategic business investment. In the States we made investment to Yahoo! Inc. That was about 10 billion yen. In Yahoo! Japan it was 100 million. In Alibaba it was 2 billion. So \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but all of those brought us about 1 trillion yen latent gain. But of the timing where we started, the market just didn\\'t understand what our intention. That was not understood at all. And that situation lasted for some years, investment in States and in Japan and in China, one by one. We are always looking at the situation -- contemporary situation and we make a step forward. And the -- this one, listed in Hong Kong, Alibaba, this is just a part of the Alibaba Group. B-to-B business was listed this time and the value of the market is now 1.2 trillion yen. My personal view is actually that Taobao or Alipay have bigger potential than this B-to-B Alibaba business. Taobao or Alipay and also Alisoft and Yahoo! China, those are not listed. But still those are in the group of the Alibaba Group Holdings, Limited. This -- the parent company, the Alibaba Group Holdings, Limited of those unlisted companies is a part of our group and we have a 33% stake in it. And those are great potential companies under Alibaba Group Holdings, Limited. The about 2 billion yen when we invested initially is not only for the Alibaba, which has become quite prominent this time. And Taobao is equivalent to Yahoo! Auction in Japan. The number of articles traded on this site is about 10 times bigger than that of Yahoo! Japan. It has grown so greatly. And this Taobao is a joint venture started three years ago with the 50 shares between SoftBank and Alibaba Group Holdings, Limited so this is a very good example of synergy, of a collaboration. I was kind of half forcing the management team of Alibaba Group Holdings, Limited to start this Taobao business. And the necessary fund at that time was provided by SoftBank Corp and that was about three years ago. And Taobao was successful and this B-to-B, Alibaba had another synergy to grow. And because we had started Taobao, therefore Alipay also had a synergy effective growth. And accordingly again Alisoft has a success as well. And now what is the company, this Alibaba? It\\'s a B-to-B e-commerce company and it has the overwhelming number one share in B-to-B e-commerce field. 51% share that was last year\\'s and now it\\'s a 69%. The market share it was about a 50% one year ago and that is now close to 70%. And this figure is for the first quarter of this year. So therefore today I believe this number is bigger. The B-to-B members is more than 20 million. It\\'s not consumer members. But the B-to-B members that is over 20 million. And every kind of articles and goods are traded B-to-B on this Alibaba. And we have about 10 or more billion yen of sales, and about 2% of this over 20 million customers are charged and billed. And that just gives us this more than 10 billion sales because two years ago we did not charge anything to those members. So now it\\'s just the 2% but if we decided to charge 20% of the customer base then what will happen, or 60% or 80%? Will we charge them? What will happen? So the B-to-B itself in China is growing. So in Alibaba I believe that because most of the customers that they are providing a servicing free of charge and still are gaining this much of the revenue. So we see the high potentials and much room there to grow. That\\'s something that we\\'re highly expecting on. And next is the Taobao. As of today Taobao is providing a service free of charge. Yahoo! Auction, the first three years that they provided service free of charge and that\\'s why that they gained the overwhelming shares in the market and gained the number one position in the market and so same as that, that the China \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in China, Taobao taking about 80-some percent of the market shares. And this is again the overwhelming number one position. Until we get into -- step into that market eBay was taking the number one position but actually after we stepping in this Taobao, we novel again. So this auction making a rapid growth. And I\\'ve mentioned earlier listed products. As of June 2007 there are 75 million items are listed. And as of today we believe that it is exceeding much more than that and about 10 times as much as Yahoo!\\'s number of listed products actually. So with this one year that it has been doubled. So we making a goods transaction using Taobao or Alibaba in that time how you pay or make any payments -- that\\'s the time that you use this Alipay, which is becoming more general in the Chinese market. This Alipay, almost 80% of the Taobao users are using this Alipay for the payment so as a result of success of Taobao, Alipay actually making a good launch. So everyday basis that increasing 80,000 users, and this Alipay not only for Alibaba Group\\'s payment settlements but also used more than 300,000 e-commerce businesses. And they chose Alipay for their payments. US eBay has a company called PayPal which is equivalent to Alipay. But in this PayPal some percent of the transaction amount automatically charged. That\\'s the business model that PayPal is doing. As of today Alipay is providing the service free of charge, from the strategic point-of-view but once they start charging -- decided to start charging as PayPal does then that\\'s going to be the tremendous profit that they will be able to expect. There are more than 300,000 e-commerce business is using Alipay as their standard payment scheme. And this Alipay aligned with major banks in China including four mega banks so this is something very -- a rare case. And Alipay provide online software to SMEs, several online softwares providing to small to medium-sized enterprises. Not only that, that the supporting e-commerce sales, internal management, instant messaging, and this is actually increasing tens of percents \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, about -- some tens of percent monthly basis so this is another thing that we are expecting on. So we said that Asia \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that the number one biggest internet company in Asia plus mobile phone equals to SoftBank. So what is SoftBank when we\\'re asked or sometimes that the people question us about? This is not the number three mobile company but actually this is the number one internet company in Asia. That is SoftBank, which just started the mobile business. So that\\'s how we can describe ourselves. So in summary that we\\'re having the number one portal, number one C-to-C, number one search plus number one B-to-B, number one C-to-C, number one online payment in China. Those are belonging to us. And on top of that, that we would like to further grow the Mobile business. And there are several internet companies that we making an investment, too. And companies that we\\'re making an investment to, how are they doing with this IPO? In US these companies are the ones that we are already made an investment and they made an IPO. And in Japan these companies that we made an investment, those are all -- went public. And in China, as of today Alibaba went public and other than that we making \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\'re seeing those companies that we\\'re making investment to is -- went public. So there are about 40 to 50 companies, I believe. So in Japanese economy or in history, the companies below you are more than tens are making -- going public. That\\'s something very rare in Japan case. And I don\\'t believe that there are another example like this in the other countries. I\\'ve mentioned that investment funds are making investments for the companies to go IPO or the venture companies, using other companies\\' money for the operations. That is the case that we see but like us operating company, our strategic purpose making a investment of several percent, like 30% or so and taking a management position, and after then making a strategic alignments are also conducted. That kind of group is very rare and probably we are the only one that are doing such a thing. And another thing we can say is that these are all within the internet scope. So that\\'s the biggest difference against the venture capitals or the investment fund. So only in one segment focused for the investment and those are going public one after another in our major markets. So here, as you can see that SoftBank is a strategic internet company. So we have infrastructure, portals and content. That\\'s our strategy so that we\\'re making a strategic map like that to lead to this score. So this is not any accidentally things happens but actually that we made it happen. So this strategy map has been drawn through before then. And we made it in order. First that we made an investment to US and have some timed work coming to Japan, and then by using this time difference, like we\\'re running on a time machine and going to the China. And so the one with the fastest market in United States that we were able to collect those investments and make it capitalized and using that, that we made our investment to Japanese market. And some of them we made it to cash to again have a strategic investment to Chinese markets. So this is the one streamline and all the time that the internet is the key word. This internet company SoftBank, why did we stepping into \\xe2\\x80\\x93 step into mobile market? Because mobile has been used as the voice machine so only say, \"Hello,\" and, \"Goodbye.\" That\\'s the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 kind of the only use for the mobile. And that was the kind of a first stage and now that we are heading towards the second stage, which means that not the voice machine but the coming into the internet machine era. So that\\'s how I see the mobile phone. So as you can see on your right hand side this is our full face model, and this that you see the Yahoo! mobile portal. And using this portal you go into news, weathers or share price so a variety of the informations can be accessible through mobile. And also that you can enjoy the streaming, like Yun said. So from text to streaming like YouTube or those kind of service available out there but the internet is evolving as well. So far that the internet world was dominated by text but that these days have been migrated into a streaming type of a service. So that\\'s one of the reasons why that the SoftBank started the Mobile business so not a voice machine but an internet machine, that\\'s how we see the mobile. And that\\'s the reason why that we started or launched the Mobile business so that we are not the second runner but we are actually came out from the internet world. And the number one internet company in Asia with our knowledge and know-how on the internet and that is spreading into the Mobile business. That\\'s the -- our mid to long term vision of SoftBank. So SoftBank, a lifestyle company in the 21st century as our goal in the fundamental management policy endeavoring to benefit society and the economy, and maximize enterprise value by fostering the sharing of wisdom and knowledge gained through the IT revolution. That\\'s our formal presentation. Thank you very much. ',\n",
       " '2007 Q3': \"I'm Son from SoftBank. Thank you very much for coming today. In the earnings results announcement today, first of all, I would like to mention that this is a first year for the Internet machine, which means that the mobile becomes the Internet machine. This is what, I would like to touch on later on amongst the slides and how we vision, visualize the mid to long-term period of our strategy and why we have been entered to the mobile market. That's what I would like to explain later. So again, first year of Internet and we are going to have several measures to support that year. And to do so operating income, cash flow, business models, all those also is going to be even more important. So first, I would like to start with the financial highlights. But latter half of the presentation, I would like to share with you the mid to long-term strategy of SoftBank. So I'd like to go into the presentation. First is the highlights. First item is the consolidated earnings results from first quarter to third quarter, nine months period we have increased by 32%. Net income 4.2 times as much. Today we have just announced that our one month's net addition, again that we are able to get the number one position, nine months consecutive number one net addition has been achieved, which we just announced today with the figures. And third one is the new plans and the price plans to be launched in the series. We have already been -- launched some of them but I would like to go into the details in a later slide. Page three, these are the detailed figures, net sales nine months period that we have exceeded JPY2 trillion, EBITDA 483 operating income, 260 ordinary income, 231 net income is 93 billion. Year-on-year as you can see on your right hand side, all the figures has showing the increasing trend. Next slide, net additions for nine months. When looking back one year ago was only a few net additions, like 1 million for the net on NTT DoCoMo, and then KDDI was 1,990. But for this year, same nine months, we've been able to increase by 1,000 -- 900,000. DoCoMo decreased down to 530,000. KDDI also decreased to 1,000 -- 370,000. So net addition wise, for nine consecutive months that we are able to gain the number one position. And the nine months up until December comparing year-on-year with the competitors, again, that you can see we've been able to gain the number one position as well. And operating income page six. This is the comparison a year ago. And we've been able to increase by 32%. Same nine months in last year 197 billion but this year 260 billion, so increased by 32%. For your reference, comparing with the competitors of ours, KDDI 17% increase, DoCoMo decreased by 8%. Consolidated net sales, we've been able to achieve exceeding 2 trillion and this is the first time ever since our establishment of the business. And by segment base, as you can see in the slide number 10, EBITDA for nine months 26% increased, 483.7 billion. Page 12, this is the breakdown of the EBITDA by segment. Operating income, as mentioned earlier, increased by 32%. And when it comes to by segment basis, page 14, all the segments being enjoying the increase, ordinary income 231 billion. And inside of that as you can see in the yellow portion, this is the -- sometimes I mention the 10 priority cost is seen in different colors in before, but this time again, that we need to use different colors for the temporary income. If we only use the different colors for the negative figures that doesn't -- isn't fair. So even in one-off income we should show you the breakdown. This is the impact of IPO of Alibaba.com because Alibaba.com doesn't go public every year. So impact-wise for our accounting book, 57.2 billion is reflected to our ordinary income. So in a real term of ordinary income, you just simply deduct 57 from 31. That's the real -- I mean, excluding the one-off effect, which is about 170 or 60 or so. So that's the 160 to 170 is about the apple-to-apple comparison compared to the previous year. But even having said that, still we're making good progress on the ordinary income of SoftBank. Next slide is the consolidated net income. This too is fair to see, deducting 57 from 93. But even you compare the purple-to-purple you can see we are enjoying the increasing trend. In net -- consolidated net income before tax 217. But net income that comes down to 93.1. Tax relatively high seems like to be reflected, but some of them are one-off things. Slowly, but having a better tax rate. Cash flow page 18. Operating cash flow we've been able to show the positive figure here, 57.2 billion. On your right hand side, you see 240. This is coming from increase of installment receivables. As you know that mobile handset is sold under installment program to the customers. And this is used as our own installment and do the financing to selling to the customers. In that portion, that we need we have a one off-cost, which is 240 billion, but about the equivalent figure. On the same time, we make it securitized. So we have a cash flow from -- financing cash flow with 224 billion. So those two are about the balanced figure, so the real operating cash flow you can add up those 57 to 240 from installment receivables and 224 of the securitizing of the installment receivables. Investing cash flow is the -- some other parts. Please -- all those are going to the page 19 cash position. This is the unused -- including unused portion of credit line facility. We have about 600 billion. Then page 20, net interest-bearing debt. On your right hand side of the graph the grey color and the pink color one is the one from the -- relates to the acquisition of Soft -- Vodafone. And this is under schedule for the repayment. And other than that is the blue and purple. It's about -- making progress or the decrease by JPY100 billion or so on every year basis. Next is the EBITDA margin, page 21. You see the each segment EBITDA has been improving. And comparing that with the other companies, NTT consolidation or KDDI -- it's this KDDI as well, the consolidated base -- sorry, it doesn't say consolidation, but the KDDI as well is the figure from consolidation of KDDI. And comparing all those three companies as you can see our EBITDA margin is coming very close to, or almost equivalent to the KDDI consolidation figure. Net -- against net interest-bearing debt, how much is EBITDA, the EBITDA ratio. Meaning that EBITDA is something very close to operating cash flow figures, then about 3.8 times as much for the debt. So other CapEx -- without any CapEx or investment, debt can be repaid within 3.8 years as a potential capability. In that portion as well we've been making a good progress every year basis. Other financial index. All the financial index are making improvement. EBITDA margin, equity ratio, ROE, DE ratio, net DE ratio, all the items is showing a good progress. Going to the mobile communications operations, as I just mentioned we have achieved the number one of net addition for the consecutive nine months. Today at the announcement of the net addition for the month of January, we acquired actually 66% and KDDI 27% and DoCoMo 7%. And our share of the net addition among the three players has increased further. Just for your information, this number for our case includes -- excuse me, has prepaid excluded. But KDDI has the prepaid increase within this number. So if you just compare the postpaid mobile phone users alone then our share might be higher. And for DoCoMo's case, they include non mobile phone subscription such as a data card embedded in vending machines. That's what I heard. So from that point of view, if you just think about the pure sense of mobile phone subscription and the net addition, then our number might be higher. And then, if you look at the quarterly trend then I think it's easier to understand. And that is shown on page 27. When it was Vodafone K.K., you can see the red line. It was quite stagnant. And when we bought it, then quarterly basis you can see our steady growth. To support this growth our marketing and the TV commercials have been successful. And for the last one year, we had the number one for two consecutive months as well as other companies in the past. But if you look at the all categories, by company, by production, by brand then in all the three segments, the Triple Crown is difficult to be achieved. And all the companies tried to win the Triple Crown. And actually December last year we missed the Triple Crown, but up to the January last month we have achieved five times this Triple Crown, which is quite a happy news. And we'd like to keep this momentum. So those are our efforts. And thanks to those efforts, we have seen the increase of intention to continue use. And last year we had a bottom when the MNP started. But now it's 86%. Customers can change operators using MNP. And after customers changes the operators, there is a certain institution called Brand Research Institute, which conduct survey among those people. And for the first time ever, we have achieved the number one satisfaction from the users who have changed their operators. In the past it was KDDI but now that's us. And this is quite a good news to us, because when customers switch in to our services, and if they think I shouldn't, then it's quite a sad story and regrettable. But we have more and more customers, who are happier than before switching in. And then that leads to a lower churn rate of 0.88% which is below 1% finally. About a year ago, when it was Vodafone K.K. it was over 3%. The churn rate was over 3%. That means about 40% of the customers terminate our services a year. So how many customers do you acquire, but all of them just disappear in two years. That is quite a sad news. And also from the cost point of view, it is not good at all. However, fortunate enough, most of the customers on our service are now 3G customers. And their churn rate is decreasing steadily. And I think the next topic is the most interesting topic for you, ARPU. ARPU and the number of the customers impact the performance. And if you look at the number in the financial reports then you see all your ARPU is 4,520, that low. That might stir your concern. But if you look at the next page, that shows the reality because we have introduced a system to separate communication fee and handset cost. And we introduced it ahead of other companies. So as a traditional method of sale, handsets were sold at almost JPY0 and the communication fee includes the cost of handset, with a rough calculation. That was the traditional way. But if you continue that, then you cannot stop customers changing handset every three months or six months. And those customers will have advantage against the customers who use one handset for longer-term. Then that is not fair to customers at all. That was how we see the traditional sales. So separating the communication fee and cost of handset was a thing we have done ahead of the other competitors. And the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications just gave a guideline and -- to the industry, and DoCoMo and AU have decided the installment sale -- excuse me the separate pricing sale. And we do have the installment sale of handset. And that means customers pay installments monthly for the handset cost. And if you just add up that installment portion, then last quarter, last fourth quarter it was 5,430. And the third quarter of this year 5,520. Therefore you can see we hit the bottom in the fourth quarter of last year. So how much customers pay a month shows the actual number of ARPU. So if you look at that figure then you don't have to worry about it too much. It's not really declining. So that is how you can see this graph. And our basic strategy, our ARPU compared to DoCoMos and AUs is lower, but still we'd like to capture more customers. So first strategy is to expand the share and you can see it's colored in pink. So it's like we are going to take the surface first. That is our basic strategy. And when it comes to the calculation of revenue it's quite simple, per user revenue times the number of customers. The number of customers times unit price of customers. So instead of bringing up ARPU, we focus on the expansion of the customer base. And one of the example is here, which was started on the first of this month, that is the White Plan student discount. White Plan achieved the 10 million subscribers for the last 12 month and it has JPY980 of the monthly service charge. Other companies charge over 1,000 or 1,000 something. But we provide our service with JPY980 per month to customers. And for students alone, and also for the three years, we will not to charge this JPY980 per month. That means it's over JPY30,000 something merit to your customers. For instance the senior of the college, senior students of the college joins this service in February or March, but still they can enjoy this free of charge monthly fee for the coming three months. Even the graduate students can join this service. Then they can enjoy three years free of charge of monthly charge. And the packet flat rate it starts from 980 excluding tax, but that also starts from JPY0 just for students. So students can use this data communication charge -- free of data communication charge for the basic monthly charge. And there is a -- student users of SoftBank mobile can talk to their SoftBank mobile users up to the 9 o'clock in the evening for free of charge. And also we have 10,000 and over contents available for students. Mail free of charge, and content free of charge and the basic monthly fee free of charge and also the data communication charge of the monthly charge is free, then now what they have to spend their money? So from the student's point of view this is quite beneficial. And now we are focusing on the expansion of customer base. We only have a 7% share in the students' market. The total share is 7%. So our priority is to achieve 93% of the students, the remaining portion. If the -- our competitors try to do this, then they will have a quite a drop of revenue from the existing student users. Therefore this kind of service is difficult for them to implement. So we can call it as a merit of the vulnerable ones. So this is a quite unique one for us. Then the second strategy, when we get customers then we try to expand their ARPU. How? We emphasize on the increase of data ARPU. We cannot expect that people start talking over the phone for more minutes suddenly. And we cannot think of the higher prices. And also we cannot bring up the packet unit price. But fortunately enough, our users on average have a lower data ARPU. And also we have the lower 3G proportion in the customer base. But now it's increasing. And we'd like to pull up the data usage as well. And we are introducing handsets which are good for data usage, HSDPA handsets and also the big monitor ones. And digital comic or digital news which can be enjoyed on a full screen and also music and game content are coming as well. At the beginning I just mentioned this year is the first year of the Internet machine. And the mobile phones are going to be used for Internet access. That means we will have the more traffics of data. So it's not like bringing up the price for packet, but we'd like to bring up the usage or volume of data. And we see there are opportunities for that. And 2G and 3G handset revenue structure, just for your information. For the 2G handset, they just use the data only for mail. That's why the data ARPU is low. And much portion is coming from voice usage. In the -- there are various ways of using data in the -- like music, games, there are several ways of using data. And from now on we're going to be going beyond 3G. So improve reach, 3.5G which means HSDPA period is coming. That's how I see. And I'm repeatedly saying that the first year of Internet machine. And using mobile as Internet machine we have to ensure the speed which is 3.5G, or also known as HSDPA speed, is necessary. So far in 2G, 384k bit per second is the speed for 2G. But when it comes to HSDPA, 3.6 megabit per second is available. So it's about 10 times as much of the speed. Of course it depends on the congestion of networks. So the effective speed wise it's about five times as much or so. But at least, using 3G handset doing the Internet browsing you see some troublesome. But when it comes to HSDPA handset this is going to be very smooth and speed is going to be from five times to 10 times so is enough speed to enjoy Internet using mobile handset. So starting from this year we are going to introduce such handsets as the first year of Internet machine. So we're going to increase the Internet machines rapidly. And to do so we need to increase the handsets of 3G. And about a year ago when we acquired Vodafone Japan, the majorities was still the 2G handsets. However, after we changed the management to SoftBank, we've been making a rapid shift towards 3G and now exceeding 71.6% of 3G handsets -- excuse me, 3G subscribers. And even in the 3G it has to be HSDPA, the high speed. And we're now providing 47 prefectures across the nation. Compared to the other countries in the world, HSDPA network coverage is far better compared to the other countries. So we're increasing nationwide of covering the -- for HSDPA. And the number of handsets for the HSDPA, this too we're working on to increase the handsets. Right now, 16 models, with the spring 2008 models which we just announced the other day out of, 16 models are available with the 3G HSDPA high speed capable handsets so called. In the last one year, spanning this one year, the number of models we introduced for HSDPA has increased from four to 28 handsets models. So we're making a big jump here. As a matter of fact at three o'clock today we made a announcement for earning results. And I made a wrong comment, statement there regarding the HSDPA number of handsets for the other competitors, at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. And number of AU, the models of AU, I probably made a misstatement for something like three or so. But these three models, Revision A -- number of models for Revision A, so 3.6 -- excuse me, DoCoMo introducing 22 and 28 from SoftBank. And those numbers with the HSDPA, we're making more numbers of HSDPA handsets compared to DoCoMo, but when it comes to AU they don't adopt the technology of HSDPA. DoCoMo does adopt -- is adopting HSDPA. So that's how we can count the number of capable handset. But when it comes to AU, they're adopting Revision A technology, which is 3.1 megabit for the downlink speed. We're having 3.6 bit. So something equivalent to HSDPA speed is available with three handsets from AU. So we can say something very close to it, which is WIN handset, which is Revision 0 they call it, which is 2.4 megabit speed. They have about 20 some models. So it depend on how you call it as a 3.5G handset. Otherwise the number of handsets available is different. But when I say 3.5G or high -- if we say 3.1 megabit Revision A, then there will three handsets available from KDDI but if we also include Revision 0, which is so called WIN, they have about 20 or so number of models as well. So it depends on the definition of the 3.5G. So that's something I would like to revise my statement the way I made at the Tokyo Stock Exchange three o'clock today. In any way with 3.6 megabit high speed handset, that we're making a rapid increase available in the market. In overall handsets, last week I made announcement on spring model for 2008. We added 16 numbers, NTT DoCoMo 13, KDDI 11. And this 13 by DoCoMo has already been announced last year December, plus something launched recently. So we call it like something equivalent to spring model. And KDDI launching after February with 11 models, and DoCoMo 13 and us it's 10 -- 16, excuse me. Out of these new models, one seg capable handsets we are introducing 10 versus DoCoMo four, KDDI eight and when it comes to global roaming service, almost equivalent to 99% available in the world wide, which we are seven handset versus five from DoCoMo versus one from KDDI and this one available handset even not available with one seg. When it comes to organic EL or also known as OEL we're introducing three, KDDI two and zero from NTT DoCoMo. Number of colors, we are making the color for models with 57, 34 from DoCoMo, 38 from KDDI. So at least we can avoid that there are no any options or no any colors or not much functions, those things that we used to be held by customers at the time of Vodafone Japan. As I'm making remarks about how we're competing against competitors, up until one year ago, or six months ago many of the Japanese people may had a kind of negative image towards Vodafone after -- or the SoftBank. And the people thought that you had a color phone and a variety of handsets and the SoftBank probably had negative image of the few numbers of handset or few number of colors. But I'm making that totally changed, colors, one seg, functions, designs, organic EL, global roaming. Well these days DoCoMo is making a big marketings on the global roaming, but number-wise we are competing against them. Page 49 there are variety of handsets we're introducing. And the basic ideas of our handsets DoCoMo k705 series, 905 series, there are only two series from DoCoMo and AU. From understanding of KCP only the one single platform that they're integrating handsets but we're trying to be more flexible. Free ideas like smartphone, character handset, stock trading handsets, so a variety of the handsets are available from SoftBank including Internet machine. So number of options are much more than competitors for customers to choose. Part of which business partnership with the Disney Mobile. Under our survey the interest from customers encouraged our shops very high towards Disney mobile. Actually I myself didn't expect this much of the interest coming from the market, especially twenties, thirties females showing quite a high interest and making good enquiries about it. As you know Disney not only Mickey Mouse, but they do also have a lot of characters in the Disney World. It's not only changing the exterior but also having a Disney button instead of Yahoo! button. And pressing this Disney button, you'll be seeing the exclusive portals which is the partnership between Yahoo! and Disney. You can still enjoy the weathers, commutes, everything but especially Disney contents are very rich here and targeting twenties, thirties females like a gourmet informations or cosmetic informations or fashion informations. Those are kind of focused to get the support from those customers targeted. And on top of that, the decoration mail, which is very popular even for my daughter that is receiving a decoration mails to me and this decoration mail in this Disney mobile you'll be able to enjoy all the Disney world with very beautiful designs and that's the standard function available in this handset. So much of the Disney World is available and you can send out the message and the pictographs is using these Disney characters and has a special design by Disney for the Disney pictographs as well. Main menu? Anywhere you see it's Disney everywhere. When you go to Disneyland you see the road, trees or even the airs you breathe. You feel like you're in the Disney World. You can feel that. No trash at all. And they have good greetings to the customers. And all the -- whole the Disney World is provided to the customers, and the customers can enjoy fully. And this Disney mobile, when you open that up or you hold it, you can feel the same way like receiving mails, sending mails, ringing tones, everything are under the Disney World and that will be available from next month, March 1 and at the SoftBank shops only it's going to be available. And we've been introducing several models. And I'd like to show you some videos of introduction of the spring models. [VIDEO PRESENTATION] Well, today is not handset release announcement, so I do not repeat too much about the handset. But compared to your image about the SoftBank Mobile handsets, maybe you can just refresh it. And we have good ones. And from now the main topic I'd like to mention today starts. This year is the first year of the Internet machine. So far most of the customers used personal computer to access the Internet. And 270 million units of personal computer are sold a year. And usually customers spend two hours a day, maybe on average it's less. But these 270 million units of personal computer maybe home or office. Excuse me. When you're at schoolwork or when you're at office, and your home computers are not connected to the Internet usually. And as for the mobile phone 1.1 billion per year is shipped. And mobile phone I think most of the people make it on usually 24 hours a day and its one unit per person. And people just carry it wherever they go. And why is the mobile handset are not like Internet? And there are three reasons for that. The first one is a slow, too slow speed of communication. The second is a too small size of monitor. And the third is the speed of CPU is not high enough. I think those are the three major reasons. Without any one of them mobile handsets cannot become Internet machine. And those three element are needed for the Internet machine. And this year is a crossing point for them to become available. And Japan is the first place to have these three elements crossing. I mean, handsets can be available in other countries, but when it comes to the speed of transmission and communication, that means the speed of HSDPA, and it has to be 3.6 meg bit or even higher. Then America or European countries or other Asian countries do not have this environment. There are some trial or pilot type of services, but there are no countries with the service available nationwide. And Japan is the only country with that ability. So the size of monitor and the CPU speed and there is the networks speed, those three element will become fully available in Japan. Therefore I think this year is -- it should be called the first year of the Internet machine. So after the 3.5G, that means 3.5 meg bit speed or higher speed devices are available, then Internet will be used much more on mobile handset. 3.6 megabit speed or lower speed than that, that means general 3G handsets. In that sense then I think the phone companies are the key players. Handsets and -- handsets are used for voice and mail or i-mode. If that's the case, then that is just like an advantageous environment for phone companies even in the other countries as well. But after the 3.6 megabit speed, the main use of the mobile handset will be the Internet. Then Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo!, those companies leading the world for the Internet service, actually are trying to bring the Internet to mobile handsets. Therefore I'd like to call this year this is the year of the Internet machine. Therefore SoftBank has already entered to the mobile telecom industry. So HSDPA, that means higher speed than 3.6 meg will be available. And that means an environment of the Internet machine will be available. And the speed of the CPU on mobile handsets will be good enough for the Internet browsing on handsets. And the graphic engines will be enhanced as well. So that is quite interesting. That means the timing will shift from the phone companies to Internet companies. If it's just for voice and mail services, then the infrastructure or pipe will be good enough. But what is going through the infrastructure and how we will make the customer to enjoy that more, those will be the key element. And when that kind of time comes, then content, portal and search and infrastructure those have to be provided seamlessly, at least with a good understanding of each market will give you advantage. There are so many companies in the world and I just picked up three groups. For instance Google case, they have a YouTube for content. They bought YouTube recently. And other than that they do not have any content. And NTT group, they have infrastructure, but as for the portal search or content on top of it then their presence is almost zero. That is how we understand them. So world-wise, if you look at the group of companies, then you can see there are good -- group of companies who has only the infrastructure or the portal or content. But there are not so many group of companies who have all of them. Mobile phone will become an Internet, I just mentioned. So the companies whose main business is Internet has mobile telecom. I think that will become the global trend. And I think this is going to be a very major trend for the mid and long term. So PC Internet and mobile handset will be the mainstream in the world. And the second, winners in the Chinese market will be winners in the global market. So far winners in the American market are the winners in the global market in various industries, for instance automobile, or home appliances or Internet. In all the industries, winners in the American market are the winners in the global market. For your reference, as of yesterday closing figure top five market capitalization company we see those five and three out of which are Chinese enterprises. Looking back five years ago, 10 years ago we never imagined like this situation. And that's why SoftBank also working on China market or the Asian market, for example Alibaba group, and other than that we have several Internet company we have. But major one is the Alibaba group which is the biggest Internet company in China. In Japan we have Yahoo! Japan. Yahoo! Japan which is the number one Internet company in Japan. And number one company in China, Alibaba group. And both are owned by SoftBank Group. So Alibaba plus Yahoo! equals to Asian number one Internet company. And Asia's number one Internet company plus mobile to become the Internet machine equals to SoftBank. It's very simple math that you can see. So it's like E=MC2. So Asia number one Internet company that we would like to become equals to world number one Internet companies. And that will be in 10 years, 20 years or it could be earlier than that that we can become the world number one Internet company. So those who win over their mobiles is going to be the one to be the winner for the Internet world. So looking 10 years, 20 years these two, China and mobile, those two of the winners become the Internet number one in the world, that's how I see the situation, equals to SoftBank. So we, the Internet company goes to SoftBank, so we -- because working on the mobile before then we acquired Japan Telecom. So since SoftBank is the communication company and that's many people see us, as a definition of the company. However, this is only the current situation, or current postures that you see. See five years later, 10 years later, mobile is going to be equals to Internet. And that's how people is going to understand as well. 10 years before when we say PC, PC equals the Internet. That was the period that we used to be. And all the management resources has been focused on the Internet, never thought about any negative figures. And SoftBank's softwares on PC or the distributions, we bring that over to Internet. So we didn't really pursue the short-term profit. But we put the resource on to the Internet, on PC. And now as a next revolution of Internet, mobile Internet. There are about 1.2 billion distributions for mobile. And all the handsets to be 3.6 megabits, that we can call it, that's an Internet machine. And that's how we can settle the infrastructures in the capable handsets. Something very SoftBank colored handset is going to be available with the SoftBank content is going to be available for the mobile Internet. So it's not like SoftBank going here to there and jumping around, but we have strong -- but one strong policy to be Internet company. Even that we put the focus on the broadband back then, but the broadband was also the Internet, mobile is also the Internet. So SoftBank has been having strong policies to become the world number Internet company. So once again that I would like to remind you that SoftBank is to be the number one Internet company for mid to long-term period. So that's the company that we are targeting in the 21 century. And ever to benefit society and economy and maximize enterprise value by fostering the sharing of wisdom and knowledge gained through the IT revolution.\",\n",
       " '2007 Q4': \"I am Son from SoftBank, good afternoon. So the point toward highlight for this time earnings result. I believe this page explains the most and very important for us. And I believe this page is going to be the key word continuously for coming ten years and its going to be repeatedly used, I believe, so I would like to share with your today. Winners in the mobile internet market are winners in the internet market and winners in Asia are winners in the world for these 2 points. And these two is going to be our key words and also will be the base for the coming tactics or strategy. And as long as you understand in that way that you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I believe that you will be able see the core reason or the common reason why that we have been working such tactics or strategy, so I would like you to keep this is in you memory. Now I would like to go on to the details of the earnings results. We have three highlights this time. First toward number one mobile internet and our mobile business. We have been able to achieve number one net additions in fiscal year 2007 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 largest consolidated results since foundation and a vastly expanding trend in operating cash flow. And in more details as you see in this page, 2.7 trillion for net sales, 626 billion first to achieve or excuse, 600 billion for EBITDA, operating income also the first time to be in this scale 324, ordinary income 258, and the net income 100 billion. So all of these numbers is exceeding compared to given number from last year. And next page, page 5, one year before net addition was like this and spending one year. Only the SoftBank were able to increase the number of net addition. The other two competitors actually lost in number of net addition. Year on year basis we have 3.8 times as much of net addition and also operating income. We've being having aggressive acquisition of customers at the same time we were able to increase the operating income by 20% to \\xc2\\xa5324 billion. Next slide going forward is the consolidated earnings results, past five years you see the trend of the net sales, as you see from this that it was \\xc2\\xa52.72 trillion for fiscal year '07. And the net sales by segment in page 11, as you can tell from this page that a large contribution was made from mobile communications, but the other segments also making a smooth operation. EBITDA looking back five years, we have largely improvement in EBITDA, now in the 600 billion level, EBITDA by segment on page 13. And operating income, just about three years ago, we had negative figures in operating income. It seems like about five or ten years ago but it's just about three years ago. So three years ago it was negative and now that we became a largest operating income since foundation, and I think it's quite rare looking such size of the company, 324 billion. And by segment, in all of the segments we've been able to improve the operating income, not only one, but all of the segments that we were able to improve the operating income in a good balance. So I believe that not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we believe that we have been looking at a very bright future here. And ordinary income now that achieving 250 billion level. But here actually we do have the inclusion of impact of IPO of Alibaba.com. So is doesn't mean that we have every year of the IPO of Alibaba, so we see as a one-off increase of ordinary income, then the about \\xc2\\xa5201 billion for the consolidated ordinary income. Net income same, we have the impact of IPO of Alibaba.com Limited which is about 57 billion but still we making good level of net income. Going back to 2005 we have a one-off increase but that time Yahoo! Europe. Our portion of the share was sold to Yahoo! US, Germany, UK, France has been told to Yahoo! Inc. in US. Page 18 talks about the consolidated net income. In page 19, consolidated cash flow, as you can see in page 20, shows consolidated operating cash flow trend in the up to the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, that was still in red, but from the second quarter to the fourth quarter you can see the steady growth. Maybe some years ago SoftBank was considered as an investment company. There is no operating cash flow coming in, in principal. And when people say like that and it always has a negative significance, but that was how the market saw us, but as you can see it's not here on this chart. Operating cash flow is something SoftBank is now accumulating steadily, and I'd like to encourage you to have a fresh view of our business. And cash position we have about \\xc2\\xa5500 billion, and also we have the unused portion of the credit line facilities of 165 billion. And total is about 650 billion. And the next page talks about capital expenditure. As you can see the peak was in fiscal year 2006. And now it's going down and in the fiscal year 2008 we expect we will have less expenditure. Page 23, interest bearing debt and you can see the breakdown in the chart. And page 24 as you can see it here again, you can see steady progress on the debt redemption about the SoftBank Mobile loan and there was some other debt as well. And on page 25 is about the future trend and also redemption trend. And page 26 talks about our interest bearing debt to EBITDA ratio. And you can see now, the rate is going down steadily. That means we have more capability for repayment of liabilities. And the page 27 as you can see it here, the financial indexes. From any viewpoint you can see the financial indexes have been improved greatly and I'd like you to encourage to understand this chart very well. So page 28 talks about EBITDA margin by segment and here once again all of them have been improved steadily. And page 29 we just made a press release a moment ago, it's about the change in, a partial change of the articles of incorporation and we tried to have approval at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders. Non-voting preferred shares are going to be in the scope of listing. And it's already in place in April 2008 last month by TSE, and utilizing this system we would like to change part of articles of incorporation in order to have an option to use this system. And what will happen or what will be possible after this change in an up to one-to-one toward this issue of preferred shares to existing shareholders will be possible. That means per common share a maximum one preferred share can be issued for gratis. Among the shareholders as the profit per share is growing very high, therefore some shareholders encouraged us to think about the share split. I am not talking we will do that, so please do not misunderstand. So we now have a tool available, it's not just the traditional share split, but this is a non-voting preferred share issuance, and that will be of gratis issues towards the existing shareholders, and this system is now available so we'd like to be ready by changing parts of the articles of incorporation. And also among the shareholders there are people who would like to have more dividend, and that discussion is very much traditional at our AGM, but this non-voting preferred shares will be one of the options to have more dividend. So those two things are going to answer the requirements from shareholders. So now it's available, so we have this tool in our hands. In the States and also in Europe this non-voting preferred share issuance is quite common, and now that it is available in Japan as well, therefore we would like to have an option in our hands, but still there is some premise we need to meet, because now the common shares of SoftBank are included in topics, and when we have this gratis allotment one-to-one, and if the preferred shares are out of the topic, then that is meaningless, therefore as a premise of course these preferred shares need to be included in topics. And if that is certain, then gratis allotment of preferred shares to existing shareholders will be possible. So as a premise, as I just mentioned, topics inclusion of this preferred share is needed for this gratis issuance. And if we decide to use this system, then the non-voting preferred shares can be utilized to buy out a company, so we will, so if \\xe2\\x80\\x93 chance for to use this system as a tool for mis-thought to be more aggressive. Therefore we'd like to be ready and prepared. That's why we'd like to change parts of articles of incorporation. And that is about the press release we made at two o'clock in the afternoon today. Okay. Then now let's move on, page 31 talks about the mobile phone businesses results, and when it was Vodafone Japan in 2004, 2005, they had a 40,000 increase and a 117,000 increase, but after becoming SoftBank in 2006 700,000, 92,000, in 2007 it's 2.68 million. So now we have more momentum than before. And page 32, compared to DoCoMo and KDDI, they actually had a slowdown of the net increase. They had a decline in net addition. But we on the contrary increased the number of net adds. And also for the net addition share, once again we in 2007 take the top place. Page 34, on I'd like to talk about the other specific things including the price plans. In the past there was so many different platforms and it was hard to understand, that was what I had in my mind as one of the users and I believed general customers have the same thing, same feeling. And after the White Plan launch about 90% or more new customers on our services opt-out for this White Plan. So we recommend this White Plan and we made it very simple and by that our sales staff has an easier time to explain and also for the customer it's easier to understand. What's White Plan? So in one word \\xc2\\xa5980 per month and among SoftBank users you can just have free calls up to 9 o'clock in the evening. So that's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's very simple \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the simplest price plan, and that's achieved 12 million application. And in among the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 against the customer base we can see 60% of the customers are already on White Plan. And the new customers are actually choose for the White Plan. And the next is the method of sale. We are the first one to introduce the [inaudible] sale in this industry. The name is New Super Bonus. This is a service we provide and this sales method [inaudible] is the new to the industry and I believe this is the world's first sales method. And as you know Ministry of the Internal Affairs and Communications agree that this is a good one. So therefore other players are following the suit. And we believe that we have normalized the contract, and as a result we see a huge drop in churn rate, and we are very happy of our decision. And page 38, here the installment, the customers who choose this installment sales, 60% and for the new customers, over, around 90% customers purchase a handset by installment, and if you look out the consumer customer basis, then the number is higher. Next page you can see we have more than 99% customers on the 3G service for the annual/end user. And for the total customer base then it's about 75%. And for the handset lineup, we have quite a rich lineup of handsets. When it was the Vodafone, there was a criticism against the lack of variety of handsets, but now we have number one lineup in the industry \\xe2\\x80\\x93 full keyboard type and premium models and high-speed models. And you can see the various colors available in the slim type and aqueous type. So there are many handsets, including a Gondhom or Mickey Mouse handset, so everything's available from SoftBank. And as for the branding, TV commercial, if you look out the preference by product, about 4500 TV commercials per month. And for the last eight \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the last nine, excuse me, for the last eight months, seven months we achieved the number one position in preference. So almost every month, so by company, or by production or by our brand, I understand that there are a company who achieved crown for just two times. But now it's seven times in our case, including automobile industry or drink industry or electronics industries. Including all industries, SoftBank TV commercials take the first rank. I believe cosmetics companies or automobile companies have more spending in advisement. But with limited spending in advisement we have been achieving this number one for consecutive months, and I do understand that there are many dog lovers in Japan, and it's not of course just because of the dogs, but [inaudible] or our other famous talent doing their best job. And as a result brand par improvement for the last twelve months, [inaudible] have achieved the highest jump. But the SoftBank is the second. We are very happy with the result. And today actually we made a press release regarding the fusion service between mobiles and the fixed-line telecommunication. Every time we have such announcement or any other occasion that we receive the questions about is there any plan for the service between mobiles and the landline and today we made the answer for that FMC service now that the SoftBank is going to launch, which is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the service name is White Line 24. So White Plan of mobile and also Otoku Line of fixed line, between those two we are going to make the voice call between those two free of charge for around the clock. Service launch we expecting, we schedule to launch on June 3rd. So starting from 3rd of June that we going to make a domestic voice call free of charge for 24 hours between White Plan users of mobile and Otoku Line fixed-line, and next between White Plan mobile phone and the BB phone, which is IP phone of SoftBank. We have about 5 million households using this BB phone, and between those two call, that we are going make it free of charge for the domestic call for 24 hours, service name is White Call 24. So our IP phone and the mobile is going to be converted and completely free of charge voice call for 24 hours, and I think this is first service in world. So the Otoku Line, which is mainly for the corporate customers, and also Yahoo! BB phone users mainly targeting the consumers. So those two segments with the mobile phone users going to be free of charge for the voice call for 24 hours. So we have mobile and the BB phone of Yahoo! BB and also mobile and Otoku Line mainly for corporate customers. Those three communications services we are providing right now. And between those two, each is going to provide 24 hours free voice call, and we just made the press release. So this is the answers for the questions we are going to be asked by you. And we prepared a TV commercial, which is going to be broadcasted from 3rd of June. Do you know White Call, SoftBank free/please call again? [inaudible]. Can't this time. You know why? No. I bet we'll share this commercial again. Free call between mobile and home. White Call. SoftBank. Do we have Yahoo! BB users? Yes. Are you a SoftBank mobile user? No. Too bad. Why? Because, ah, running out of time. Free call between mobile and home. White Call. SoftBank. Join both Yahoo! BB and the SoftBank Mobile. Join both Yahoo! BB. Almost forgetting, what did you have for supper dear, day before yesterday? Well... Ah, forget it. Free call between mobile and home. White Call. SoftBank. So that's the, we have been focusing on the dog lovers and the cat lovers there in the market, and now that we are going to use a white cat, use as a character for the TV commercial to explain the service between the mobile phone and home phone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 home BB phone and it's going to be launched from the 3rd of June. And next the internet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the year of internet machine, we start seeing this from the previous announcement. So with this year of internet machine we've been able to support PC mail myself using every day basis. This is my personal handset and this is as you can tell full keyboard and I've being using every day and actually it's really convenient to use. Company mail, company emails, business emails, I can check and make access from this mobile to the company sever. And also the entry speed became about 3 times up to 5 times, so I'm feeling myself that speed. So once you get used to this full keyboard handset, you'll never be able to go back to the 10-key handset. So once you use it you'll never be able to get, do without it. So for example SoftBank Telecom employees now they change the business employees' handset to this machine and the SoftBank Mobile also, employees of SoftBank Mobile are also changing their employees' handsets to this internet machine. So it's going to improve your efficiency or the business and also it's more effective. So I myself experienced it, and I believe that the emails rather entering with 10 keys but should enter with full keyboard. And I feel myself that how convenient it is. Of course one set can be much enjoyable with this big screen photos, it's better in a landscape than portrait. So, that's how I felt it. So mobile it's now in the high speed era, and also the mobile broadband has arrived. Accessing internet via mobile or Yahoo! we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 since we created the Y button, Yahoo! Button, that we've been seeing this trend about a year ago from the 1st July compared to that time after we made the Yahoo! button the access to it has been increased by 21 times at much. Y button, how convenient it is. So once you use it, they become the repeated customer. So in any other world, having such exclusive button in the PC screen the Yahoo! available in the handset, I think this is the most convenient service. I actually using this service more than 10 times a day like seeing the share price or the flash reports on the baseball results, all kinds of information. And the music download actually a true mobile compared to PC, we have about 10 times as much of download access, and I think this trend is going to be much obvious. And the SMS, say mix C case about a year ago about 90% of the users who are using PCs to access the mix C. But now, sorry this is the absence of the Symbian, but it's already that 60% of the customers are using mobile phone to access SMS. So in Japan mobile is becoming the streamline for the SMS access. And airports in the year of the internet machine the six team Pacific League, we have video highlights distributed to mobile handset now. and comics in SoftBank group. We have [inaudible] or another of Harlequin, 1,000 titles. We have exclusive contract in SoftBank to distribute starting from 24th of April, first that we distributing to Yahoo! Comic that are starting the distribution. And surprisingly there are so many thousand titles on the Yahoo! Comic. But actually from number one to number ten was dominated by this Harlequin. If you go look closely it's a bit of unusual titling, but in PC from number one to number ten ranking, we have Harlequin comics dominating. And I believe that this is going to be distributed to mobile as well. So [inaudible] Ashtano Joe, Raimon, such and such comics available in mobile handset, so in this regards I believe that we're stepping ahead and also with this landscape screen customers, users can enjoy a lot of games and we are also leading this segment as well. Next is ARPU. From the financial accounting point of view, ARPU is like that. But in the reality we are the first one to start the handset installment program. And this installment portion is billed to the customers and paid to us, so in the real ARPU I believe that we should also include or add back this installment payment portion to the ARPU then we be able to tell the real payment from the customer to SoftBank. Therefore, as you can see, the green portion, those decreased portion can be covered back with this installment payment portion. And starting from the fourth quarter of the 2006 at the bottom we actually bringing back, rather increasing trend with this graph. Often analysts or the media ask that with this ARPU competition, SoftBank increasing the number of users, but the ARPU is dropping drastically so that SoftBank is not making money anymore. Such comment is frequently heard but only that's because they're looking at only the one aspect of the financial accounting perspective so if you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you have to see, not in seeing the small portion, but if you see the big picture as a communications revenue voice data and the installment. From our sense, money is money regardless where that comes from, so the customer paying every month in any name that they choose, the money or the revenue that we receiving from customer, so from that sense the real ARPU for the SoftBank actually is not that bad. And for the customer what is the White Plan for the customers, it's cheaper price and what's giving back to the customers is that for customer between SoftBank they can enjoy the voice calls in free of charge. So as a result the number of minutes for customer usage is drastically increasing, so in SoftBank users, teenagers or those younger generation have been recognized as heavy mail users, but actually in SoftBank teenagers using more of the minutes of the voice than data because they known that it's quicker to talk rather than sending mail. So only because of the price it's high, so that's why that they chose mail, but if it's free of charge it's more easy to express the feelings, so between White Plan's number of minutes per user is increasing in SoftBank, and that's been well received so far. And the next number one internet company, we've been focusing on mobile, but in specific that once again that we would like to say that we are the internet company, so mobile is only to use internet, only to use or only to enjoy internet, so we acquired the company of mobile operator but still that our focus is internet. To do internet we acquired the internet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the mobile company, so it's not the other way around, that the thing that I would like to emphasize. So Asia's number one internet company, because with Yahoo, which is the biggest in Japan, other than that we have several internet companies below us. And next biggest market, internet market to Japan is China and EBITDA is actually the largest in the Chinese market. And this Alibaba Group also is our Group company. And in addition to it in China the biggest internet company it can be called as a Chinese version of the Facebook in the States. And Xiaonei is the company, and now it's joining to the SoftBank Group. Yahoo! as the center, as a group in the Alibaba Group and Xiaonei Group and summing up all of them, then we are the number one, overwhelming number one internet company in Asia, that is SoftBank Group. Then what is Xiaonei? Xiaonei, as I just mentioned is the largest SMS company in China, equivalent of Facebook. And in Chinese, as you can see it here, that the Chinese capitals/captions for Xiaonei and they limit the users to university students. And in China, \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from 23 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 22 to 23 million students, college students are in China, and that is limited only to the college student, how they got the number of users which is registered is over the number of the college students. Why is that? Why the number exceeds the number of students \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because some students have more than one account. Therefore it's not 100% penetration against the all college student base, but 60% or more users upload their own photos and use their own name, real name and when both are used then they are able to get the star user position. And when they are star user of Xiaonei, then they have unlimited upload of photos and also email exchange among those people will be available, so there are added services available. So 60% of all students upload their photos and use their real name, and as a result, irresponsible information exchange or irresponsible activities are not observed in this community. So it is a quite a safe community, and they are thinking as a result as it is safe, so they can just upload their photos of their private parties or their own photos and they can exchange emails. And from April on this year, the students graduate from universities and start working and they are allowed to join Xiaonei's service in a different field. Up to April this year at least as they graduate in April in China. Those people who graduate from universities are now working and as they join still remain in this community. And the number of the registered users is around 26 to 25 million, yes 25 million as of the end of 2008 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 April of 2008. And usually what happens is less than half of the registered users are active. Sometimes 30% or 40%, but for Xiaonei case about 19 million users are very active. And if you look at the number of uploaded photos, of yourselves, or of your parties, of your friends, then it's about 400 million photos, many of them, quite an extraordinary number. So this many photos is uploaded to Xiaonei, and for the last two months, 100 million photos are added. And this safe community is available for star users and they feel quite safe. Therefore they can upload their private photos. And users for the numbers of the total comments, it's about 2.3 billion comments. So as now you can see Xiaonei has a great momentum of growth, and that has become overwhelming number one SMS service. And Alibaba, which is familiar to you already, its share in the B2B e-commerce used to be 68%, but now it's 75% B2B e-commerce share. It was 68% but now 75%. And also the number of users over 29 million, so once again there is nothing to stop Alibaba's momentum of growth. And year-on-year net income grew by 2.1 times. So once again net income growth is unstoppable. And the charge is increasing [inaudible] the performance is bit a not loss. And SoftBank and Alibaba established a 50-50 joint venture that is Tao Bao, and this is a 100% subsidiary in the Alibaba Group and 30-something% in Alibaba Group. About 32% of the stake in the Alibaba Holdings is owned by the SoftBank and Tao Bao is not listed yet. One year ago it had 65% of market share but now it has 84%. 84%. This is again overwhelming number one share. And this Tao Bao's users exceeded 62 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 once again unstoppable momentum. And under the Alibaba Group there is a company called Alipay this is equivalent to Paypal. eBay has Paypal and over all the transactions they charge 3%, but at the moment Alipay has a strategy to expand customer base, therefore it's free of charge. But now the number users exceeded 74 million. Once again this is overwhelming number one online payment service in China, so it's equivalent of the Paypal. It's like online Visa card if you think, if you may, so that is what Alipay does, and it has 74 million users. And now it's the overwhelming number one online payment service, and if Alipay starts charging 30 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 3% of the commission over the all transactions, then how much commission will be generated. Then Alipay with no doubt becomes a profit center, so this is quite a big potential to us. So we have done various investments, in the past SoftBank was viewed as an investment fund. Masayoshi Son is not an entrepreneur, but maybe he is a excellent investment fund manager. I am not sure if you'd say excellent or not, I don't know if it's a praise or criticism, but that was the market sense. But the difference between the fund and our service is this. We are not like a silent partner with only 3 or 2% in the stake, but 20% to 50% in a company, and we'd like to have those companies as a partner to have synergy effect, and in many cases we are the major shareholders. That is a how we position ourselves. And here you can see strategic internet-related investment in the past. About ten years ago we have invested most of our investment to companies in the States, and five years ago we changed or we shifted our focus to the Japanese market, and in Japan we invested in internet-related companies, and as I just mentioned, in many it was around a 20% to 50% of a stake. And now we are now focusing on the Chinese market, so that's a drastic shift. So we are not, if you look at each of the investments, then it looks like random shoot but we have had a grand picture. So ten years ago, focus was in the American market and five years ago in the Japanese market and now in the Chinese market, so we are shifting our focus. So return on the investment of each investment is shown on this chart, but you can see we are focusing on internet-related companies, and we have a good return, and I think this is a rare example even if you look at the world market. In the internet-related investments are listed on this chart and we have about 300 billion in total. It's 301.9 billion if you look at the detailed numbers. But it's now \\xc2\\xa52.8 trillion, so there are some which already we have sold but there are many we still hold. And the value grew by 9.4 times. Now 300 billion becomes 2.8 trillion that means \\xc2\\xa52.5 trillion profit. And if you use the normal accounting method, then this gain is not included in our ordinary profit but it's included on the balance sheet. But in many cases those have just the book value of the initial value. But if you think it for a moment then \\xc2\\xa5300 billion have become \\xc2\\xa52.8 trillion, that means \\xc2\\xa52.5 trillion of gain. Because the accounting method is conservative, therefore we put the initial value at the book value. So those numbers do not tell \\xc2\\xa52.5 trillion of gain, but in substance this is gain, but the accounting method is super-conservative. But I think we should understand what was gained as gain, so we are conservative in terms of the accounting method understanding and of course we got gains on sales. And that is the background why we are the internet number one internet company in Asia. The second theme I just mentioned at the beginning is the forecast on the mobile internet, and we would like to be the number one mobile internet company. And this is something we cannot achieve immediately by ourselves. But the other day we made a press release that was very important release, but that was kind of a very small article in the newspaper. It was smaller than the playing card. But the significance is greater, I believe. And to be the number one mobile internet company, we do need to the have a combination of Vodafone and the China Mobile, so having a three-company alliance that we set up this time. Yesterday actually in London we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I had a meeting for long hours Arun Sarin, the Chairman of Vodafone. About two, three weeks ago also we had a discussion between me, myself, Chairman of Vodafone, Chairman of China Mobile that we had a discussion over the strategies of this joint venture and also had a signature, a ceremony in Beijing, China. And the titles or the position of this is kind of taking a turn, and I have become the first Chairman of this joint venture because I started the proposal so that's why that I take a first Chairman's chair. Actually that we are the smallest amongst the three but we do have big ambitions, so we are in the equal basis of joint venture amongst three companies. And in those three companies, number of users or the charge customer we have actually 700 million users in the world. Vodafone and China Mobile and SoftBank in total there're about 700 million, so only the SoftBank itself, it's about 19 million. So for the 19 million customers, developing a softwares or building a new content on our infrastructures, even though we try to do that, but still the scale merit is not made. But if we make anything new for the 700 million customers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 new hardware, new content, new software \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if we start proposing to the outside vendors of software, hardware, content partners, they change their mind right away. Because there are customers number, talking about the number of customers is totally different. We're talking about 700 million customers, do we have, we will now distribute the ringing tone for 700 million customers, or Harlequin comics for 700 million. Actually Harlequin we have a worldwide bestseller mobile and actually we have a world thousand titles exclusive contract, excuse me rights to distribute to mobile we have it from Harlequin, and because we have a background of 700 million users, we can conclude the negotiations right away. This is just one example. But when it comes to game, game title for the mobile handset, if we're thinking about 700 million users, up until now there are several game consorts, but there are no game consorts for 700 million customers, so many consorts, but when it comes to 700 million charging every month and distributing game software to those customers, if I were a game developer, I all of a sudden have a great motivation. And I think same thing can be applied to the hardware designing. So for the SoftBank it's a very strategic joint venture. And also one third each of the equity, and it's like a partnership between two regions, like China and Vodafone, we are thus smallest amongst the three, but we would like to make money with this partnership. So we took the one third of the position. Why we were able to do so is because, Japan we have a less number of the users, penetration of handsets, still a little bit behind compared to the rest of the world. However, when it comes to 3G penetration ratio, we are taking quite a big lead compared to the other world. So 3G handset penetration we're taking a lead, and the year of internet machine, as I said, to make it to internet machine you have to be at least 3G handset available. Now it becoming 3.5G, HSDPA, otherwise that it doesn't really being the real internet machine, but this most of the handsets shipped amongst the market it became HSDPA or 3.5G handset. So those three alliance and the least number of users, but still can lead the vision is because Japan mobile user, because of the Japanese mobile users or thanks to Japanese handset vendors. We cannot all of a sudden increase the population, but because of the balanced user of the handset, we were able to have a vision to change the world handset into internet machine. So as I said in the beginning we have two cures one of that is Asia, the other is mobile internet. So mobile changes to the internet machine, so with this three partnership, three alliance that we would like to become the number one mobile internet company and become the Asia number one together with Alibaba, Xiaonei, with the mobile internet company equal to SoftBank, so SoftBank not like a traditional third player in Japanese market. We didn't have such idea from the beginning at all. SoftBank is not the third players of the mobile operator. Actually SoftBank from the beginning targeting to become the Asia number one internet company and also targeting that not world number one mobile internet company, so it's not in the same playground that we are competing. We are talking about a new or other completely different playground that for the battlefield and to become the Asia number one internet company and also the mobile internet company. Once again winners in the mobile internet market are winners in the internet market; winners in Asia are winners in the world. So we would like to make the world internet more fun, because the SoftBank is the lifestyle company in the twenty-first century that we like to become, and we would like to do our best to do so, and the broadband available to all living people everywhere. Thank you very much. \",\n",
       " '2008 Q1': \"I am Son from SoftBank. Today this is the announcement of the earning results. And last week I went to China on business and, at that time, that was my first experience since the start of Internet. The Internet started -- Internet business by SoftBank was started in 1995 and from that time, I have been traveling abroad almost every month. But at every business trip, what I do for the first time when I check in the hotel is to connect my laptop -- personal computer to the Internet. And when broadband service is available then I choose broadband, but it depends on the conditions or situation of the hotel or the room. Sometimes I needed to work on it for 30 minutes or about an hour to have a connection to the Internet. So that is quite a bothersome. But this time, it was different. For the first time in over 10 years, I didn't use my laptop at all. All needs I had at that time for business was dealt with this iPhone. So I checked my business emails and the schedule with my iPhone. And all those attachments to emails such as Excel or PowerPoint files, those were opened and I just use my fingertips to enlarge the necessary part to read. So I didn't use my laptop during my business trip the last time. For the last -- over 10 years the connection to the Internet at the hotel was kind of ritual to me and I used to carry a rather heavy personal computer with me, but it's no longer necessary because of this iPhone. So that is a proof that iPhone can give you a very easy access to the Internet and you can get push service for your business use e-mail. And with this effectiveness of -- your business is improved and somehow the sense of life is changed dramatically, so that was a great change. So during my transportation from hotel to the business venue or from the airport to the hotel, I can just finish my e-mail checking. So it's not like before. I needed to check-in and I need to check my e-mails. But that's not necessary. So I can use my time very efficiently. And also when I check my e-mails with iPhone, I can also use the iPod function. So I can listen to my music. Well, when I was young I used to listen to lots of music, but also the last several years I haven't bought any CDs or listened to my favorite music because of time constraint. But after I started using this iPhone and carrying it with me all the time then just a small time available on car or during the communication or transportation, I can do it and that's really changed the way I look up in my life. On 11th of July, iPhone was released. We released iPhone. The before and after the release of iPhone, there has been already a great shock to me, which changes the way I look at my life and it's very enjoyable. And later I would like to show you how I enjoy my iPhone. Okay. Now let's move on to the announcement of the earnings results. Today, we have three highlight. First is the performance EBITDA, operating income or the income, all of them have the record high year on year for the first quarter. Second is the Mobile Business performance and we had 14 consecutive months as number one in additions and I'd like to elaborate on the background. And the third point is iPhone 3G release and those are evaluated [inaudible]. Okay. Please have a look of page three. As you can see net sales, EBITDA, operating income, everything are going very well. Page five shows the breakdown. Per segment net sales is shown here. Mobile Communications that is mobile phone business shows a slight decrease year-on-year and the factors behind are shown on page six. In the Mobile Communications business, we were the first operator, which introduced the installment sale. And with this installment sale the sale of handsets will be recorded as the sales due to the accounting rule. But after the introduction of installment sale customers who used to change their handset every six months changed their behavior and they stay with the same handset and now it's over two years on average. So as a result, customers who upgrade their handsets went down and the number of the upgrade handsets decreased by 34%, so the decreasing handsets sales on installment went down. So it's year-on-year 34% decrease but this is already within our anticipation and we had a positive hope for that, because we'd like to encourage customers to continue to use the same handsets for longer term rather than six months or one year. And, as a result, this is actually a fair treatment for the customers who use the same handsets for longer-term. So now you know that the common day you was doing the same thing, the installment sale and that is also along with the ministries idea, and as a result the EBITDA and operating income have improved and EBITDA is shown on the page seven and operating income on page eight. As a result of more effective and efficient management, all through the segment have a better number than before. And consolidated operating income had a record high of over \\xc2\\xa554.2 billion and the net income is \\xc2\\xa519.3 billion, which is a slight down from the last year. That's because last year, we had a rather conservative provision for income tax payable for our subsidiary in US. But the last year, we had one-off time gain from that. And this year, it's smaller that's why -- so it's a grey portion here is the rather fixed or long-term ones. But the blue portion, this is a one-off time impact. So the continuous net income portion is growing steadily. Operating income and net income both are growing that means the substance is growing. And page 11 shows our net income breakdown and page 12 shows consolidated cash flow. And especially operating cash flow that is the most important items among many for business. And as page 13 shows, operating cash flow has improved by \\xc2\\xa580.3 billion year-on-year and we have \\xc2\\xa552.8 billion in black. And cash position as well, we have over \\xc2\\xa5500 billion in hand, that means we have quite abundant cash. And next is our capital expenditure, last year we hit the peak and also we had a high number two years ago and this year the number is smaller. Page 16, EBITDA minus capital expenditure, this can be called as a actual free cash flow. As you can see it here, CapEx passed the peak and it's going down and EBITDA is going up. So the actual free cash flow is growing as well. We saw that interest-bearing debt is decreasing steadily, interest-bearing debt over EBITDA ratio is the capability to repay the liabilities and as you can see this has making a steady improvement. Other improvement rate in financial indexes all of those are improving as you can see from the slide 19. EBITDA margin by segment is too, is making improvement in EBITDA margin in each major segment. Page 22, this is regarding the Mobile Business, just about two year ago, number of customers in SoftBank is going to be losing area so called and most of the industries or the media people or the sales agents people including all those that they thought that SoftBank is going to be losing alone. But, as a result, you can see that compared to the competitors for this quarter we were able to achieve close to 80% of net addition share for this first quarter, which is great news for us. In one of the source for that is shown in page 23, like in all the industry including all the deals, all the drinks what they bought all the companies producing TV commercials. There are about 4,000 some hundreds of the TV commercials are broadcasted on TV. And starting from this January to this last month, we've been taking a number one position for seven consecutive months in all the areas, all the industries, which is the first and ever in the advertisement area. In addition to that there are about 15 categories as a major for the TV commercials including performers, humorous, advertising copy, attractive products, sound, persuasive, dull but lovable, which is something like us, but soothing whatever it is that there are 15 items and out of which 14 items we were able to get the number one position, which is also first and ever. Only 6c category that we were not able to get number one because we have [inaudible], which is a little bit difficult to gain the 6c measurement, but we are very happy to see this 14. As you may know the latest... [inaudible] So, actually, [inaudible] graduated from Sorbonne University, which is revealed in this TV commercial and he speaks French. Page 26, we saw that effort that we were able to expand the cumulative subscriber and exceed 90 million and compared to the before acquisition and after the acquisition, you can see the great growth here. Churn ratio, we were able to making a steady decrease here, on page 27 and in that 80%, close to 80% of the customers are on the 3G network and out of which 0.72% are the 3G churn ratio. So we are making a steady improvement in churn ratio. As I mention earlier that the installment sales of the handsets are going on and the number of customers who make upgrade is decreasing, but at the same time making churn ratio decreasing which is ideal situation for the management point of view. So customer once they get a handset, they making a good care on their handsets for a reasonable timeframe and also are able to avoid any churn. So once you decrease the upgrade numbers, that sounds like going towards the churn, but upgrade mean us -- originally means that they maintained the handset not churn but so if you hear the news of decreasing upgrades maybe the risky but that's only risky when you have a increase of the churn ratio. But what we're aiming churn ratio decrease as well as decrease of the number of upgrades. So that that we can have a longer tenure of the customers. And we were able to achieve what as we expected. And I mentioned that the decrease in the churn, but at the same time a shipment for the new acquisitions are all 3G handsets right now so the cumulative customers number voice close to 80% to other 3G customers. In all, the new shipments are all 3G and in such 3G that we are making further decrease in churn ratio, which is happy news and ideal situation for us. Next, which is always your consideration, I believe, is the ARPU. Our competitors also will start introducing the installment sales for the mobile phone. And probably could be a first of the company who introduced the installment sales, but we were the first operator who experienced this installment sales. So how we interpret the ARPU may occur some discussion here and there are several interpretations. But competitors up until now in their communication revenue they included -- they -- excuse me, they provide the handset free of charge and incentives cannot be seen, but putting the higher communication fee or the charge to the customers. However, our case, handset cost and the communication charge has clearly separated for the customer. In this handset cost or the price or the installment price for the customers per month, plus revenue from the telecommunications. In total, those two can be the substantial ARPU or the revenue from the -- per customer, per month. Such new measures that we need to interpret otherwise we may be misleading the management directions or the evaluation of the management for the business. So we clearly separate the handset cost as an installment price, plus ordinary ARPU can be a payment -- average payment from the customers per month. And I believe that way of looking at the revenue is more close to the truth of the situation. And with that understanding, with that interpretation we'll be making a steady or a close to flat trend in ARPU. And if you see the decline of ARPU is misleading from that. So from that sense I believe, we're making a steady improvements and from now on what's happening, so far we've been making revenue mainly from revenue. And as you can see, iPhone and other handsets, handset will not be used as a voice machine, but is going to be used as an Internet machine or the data machine. So we are experiencing that already with iPhone. So we expecting rather bigger data revenue compare to voice revenue. So with that understanding, it doesn't mean that we making a decline of ARPU. And downloading music via mobile is higher than that of PC, mixi as well. Those social network service access is coming more from mobile than that of PC. And actually more than 60% access is from mobile. So now that you see that the mobile Internet period is coming in full fledge. And one of the lead of that is the Yahoo button on the handset as a standard function. Since we made this Yahoo button on the handset, we made about 100 times of the access to that for -- in past two years. So since we made this Yahoo button, mobile access to the mobile portal page has become about 100 times. So this too is making a steady growth in the customer start realizing this convenience and they start repeat using those. And 2008, as the year of the Internet machine I've been saying that quite often this year so from 2G to 3G to 3.5G to HSDPA and this year as the year of the Internet machine and background for that, saying that we have three reason. One is the communication speed starting from year 2008, years that speed has become faster, 375 times. LCD resolution, the number of dots as a definition became 24 times as much, this is a second reason. And the third reason is the CPU capability. This became 24 times as much meaning the communication speed, LCD definition, and CPU, those three are lined up and then that's the time that though we are able to say that the mobile phone is changing to the Internet machine. So, those three essential points. We -- I -- about four years ago I've been saying that that will be ready around the year of 2008 so that's why we decided to spend \\xc2\\xa52 trillion to acquire Vodafone in two years ago. And now that you see the year 2008, and this year to be the year of the Internet machine and the same thing was said by Mr. Steve Jobs by Apple, and also Google or the Microsoft. So in the Internet industry, those front runner entrepreneurs, they knew those three essentials will be ready around the year of 2008. So, that's why that we've been making a target on this year. And now that you see that the iPhone 3G launched and I'd like to show you the TV commercials of [inaudible]. I tried to ask a question to you. Who have iPhone already and using them? Could you raise your hand please? Okay, about 15% I guess, I now understand that many of you are quite advanced minds setting. And I believe the speed of life is different between iPhone owners and non-iPhone -- people without iPhone. So we can just say they are different species. Because I myself have been using many different handsets but iPhone is really, really good. It's so fun and it's adorable. 24 hours a day is not enough for me. Later, I will try to show you demonstration in person. There are several features of iPhone. The most different thing is here. There are similar hardware or similar software like touch panel and I think the similar ones are coming out from other manufacturers. The most different thing is the operating system. Macintosh OS 10 [X] is mounted, so that is quite -- a very full-fledged one. That means OS will never get obsolete, so once you buy an iPhone then in one month, in two months, in three months whenever there comes a time with new OS and you can just simply synchronize it, then you can just upgrade your iPhone. So the hardware is the same, but you can have upgraded software. So for instance, the contact search is advanced function added recently and the push mail and location information service. So like that, iPhone itself is evolving. iPhone has a full-fledged OS with it therefore instance in the past when you have certain bugs found after the release of the handset. Suddenly, you have to recall all those hardwares to rewrite software, even for simple bugs. But for this iPhone you don't need to do that. OS -- it's not like the correction of bug, but it will have a dramatic evolution. And as is the Wi-Fi that is embedded as a standard or default, so you can have a connection to 3G whenever -- at any time you want and also you can connect to Wi-Fi if you prefer higher speed. And this is quite stress free connection. So you just once set it up, just once and that is very simple and after the second time you will be connected automatically. It's really convenient. And the third point, in the States, BlackBerry is very popular among business people for reading business e-mails via company's address -- e-mail address with good security. That is available here so that's why the BlackBerry is very popular for its secure e-mail function. And the secure connection between your mobile handset and the -- your company's e-mail address is rather difficult to be realized here in Japan, especially for big companies. They are very sensitive about the leakage of information, private information protection. Therefore it's really difficult to satisfy them. But for the iPhone case, my \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's automatic linkage or synchronicity with via Microsoft Exchange. So it's a push service, push mail and also for the calendar management. For instance, your secretary input entries of your business appointments to your Outlook, then that -- it will be automatically updated with your iPhone. You don't have to do anything it's just automatic. So it's over the air, so wherever you are outside of the office, then it's just done and it's very easy and convenient. So as I just mentioned, I didn't need to carry my personal computer even I go abroad on business. So for instance, noodle shop, if you'd like to find a noodle shop then there is the map function and you can find it instantly. And the next one, this is really good. There are so many more than hundreds of applications available, games or other convenient tool applications. It's just added almost every day. So for instance, game device like DS of Nintendo or PSP of Sony. Those are game console has 1.7 title or two point something titles per unit. So two titles per hardware that is kind of average for sale. But iPhone actually had a 1 million unit sale on the first day of the release of iPhone 3G. And as for the download of the application it's already exceeded 10 million applications. That means, for instance, 10 titles for three days were downloaded. That is how it can be calculated. So my iPhone here. There are so many applications I downloaded as you can see here. And I also can add more and more to it. And as I just mentioned that I will later give you some demonstration and some are very funny and enjoyable and some are very convenient and useful. And those new applications are coming so rapidly and here are some samples. So those applications are available. In the past, for instance, the game console requires software about 4,000, \\xc2\\xa55,000 per piece and you have to go to shop, by yourself, but this App Store is just like \\xc2\\xa5100 or \\xc2\\xa5500 per software and some of the applications free of charges. And there are so many interesting ones. \\xc2\\xa5100 or \\xc2\\xa5500 game software were not available for game console so far. You have to -- and also you have to go to the store to buy softwares and if there are no \\xc2\\xa5100 or \\xc2\\xa5500 software available for game console but for iPhone you can see the increase in the variety every day. And just one touch on the screen, you can buy whatever you want. And also you can download them for free of charge. So there are so many new things coming out every day. And the other thing, so far the accessories and peripheral devices for mobile phones are not really many in the number of varieties. If you'd like to enjoy good music or good sound at home with your handset then there are not that kind of device available. But at home, I myself just connect my iPhone to a loudspeaker and I can enjoy the loud BGM because you can carry some sounds on music pieces with you. So you can enjoy it while driving your car or while you're just walking in the town. And there are several thousand of accessories already, this is a very big strength. And as for the memory, the standard has already 8 gigabytes and also 16 gigabytes. And you can have more than several thousand music pieces downloaded to them. And as you can -- as you know that it has a touch panel, which is very convenient. And, also, we have the accelometer. So like DS of Nintendo, it has a touch activator and Wii has a motion sensor, both of them are now available here with iPhone. Both features are now available for the first time with one device. This application that I just showed you is called MobileMe. It's free-of-charge and you will be able to enjoy several phones. [inaudible] that you are able to search the phone or TV commercial phones. If you want to check out who is singing or what kind of title is that, then you will able to record and close the TV stereo about five seconds or so recording and then automatically the song is searched and you'd be available to see who is singing that or many people singing that or the song titles and that's used as a social network so many people is singing the same song. Amateur people can link together and also exchange the song -- emails or exchange the emails or are you will be able to download those via iTune or YouTube that you will be able to be connected. So this is something never be imagined before and that's very convenient, very fun and myriad possibilities coming out with that. So what SoftBank is aiming for is clearly a different world from the past voice-centric, world. So we say that we'd like to make the mobile phone Internet machine from voice machine and every day new applications are coming out as I've just said. And for instance, in the past when a TV set was introduced that changed peoples' life and it used to be a black and white TV but it changed to color TV. So the same thing can be applied to mobile phone. Mobile phone, a mobile phones' main purpose \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the voice communication, but it's now going to shift to the Internet use and rapidly I guess. So mobile phones shifting from 2G to 3G and 3.9G, so it's evolving. So it's not like the telephone operators' competition as before. But it's going to be a competition among Internet companies. So from that point of view SoftBank does not see itself as a communication company. But from the time of foundation of our business I myself always advocate the digital revolution. We started with the software sale but the Internet is a connection between personal computers. And then we sell the software to those computers. So it's a connection between the Internet. And in the Internet world SoftBank actually is the second largest EBITDA generator. That means the operating income in a real sense next to Google so the second largest is actually SoftBank and eBay in the US or Yahoo in the US after SoftBank. Also for the history of EBITDA, we used to be in red but now we are in the second position following Google in the world. And Google has a platform in contents with YouTube in their business model but SoftBank has everything from infrastructure to content in its Group. For the short-run, yes, it's more effective just to focus on one business. But for long run to grow and to sustain the business then I believe, that total integration is a key, a potential key and meet a long-term vision the first is becoming a number one as a mobile Internet company and the second is a number one Internet company in Asia. As I just mentioned, I went to China on business last week and China is growing so rapidly. I assume that China will exceed the United States greatly in the number of the broadband users has already exceeded that of US. So just several years ago, the Untied State has about a 50% share in terms of the number of users of Internet around the world but several years from now, it will be around 12%. In Asia will have the 50% and China will get the major portion in it. So that time is coming. And SoftBank, SoftBank has a position of the number one Internet company in Japan and plus the number one Internet company in China. That means the number one Internet company in Asia. So Google's business model was focused on the United States and the personal computer businesses. That had a lower growth rate. But our business model has a higher growth rate. That means that Asia and the mobile Internet and we'd like to become number one in that field. That is our vision. So SoftBank will continue to state this commitment for ten years. We'd like to become mobile Internet number one and Internet in Asia. We'd like to become the number one in Asia for the Internet. The number one position in the United States for Internet was equal to the number one in the world, number one. But number one position in Asia will be the equal to number one position in the world for the future. Lastly, I'd like to add three things. And here are three announcements about iPhone 3G. So far there was not enough supply at shops and we've made a certain inconvenience among people who wanted to buy iPhone 3G. But from tomorrow on, reservations will be accepted because we have finished system development for the reservation. Sometimes this system doesn't work and that result in unfair treatment of customers. But now we are ready with the system to accept reservations for iPhone 3G. So from tomorrow whichever SoftBank shop you go, you go to will have this system ready. And the second, iPhone has a limited email storage period that was 30 days. And we heard voices that that is inconvenient and now we are ready to change it. So from today on, the storage period is unlimited up to 5,000 emails. The third point, we offered packet flat rate fall and we are going to revise it. So far, regardless how much you use, but the flat rate was \\xc2\\xa55,985. So the ceiling is \\xc2\\xa55,985 and also the bottom is a \\xc2\\xa55,985 and some customers may not use much or maybe they go abroad and they do not use iPhone they now still they have to pay this much. So that's kind of concern among the people. And against that concerned voice, we introduce \\xc2\\xa51,695 flat rate and the ceiling is just same before \\xc2\\xa55,985 and also the packet it's also \\xc2\\xa50.084 [inaudible] this is the same with the AU and DoCoMo. And DoCoMo has the full flat rate. So for the entry users, I believe that iPhone offers a lower price. So the monthly minimum charge with less usage that may occur to entry users mainly, used to be \\xc2\\xa57,280 but from now on it can be \\xc2\\xa52,990. So iPhone equal to expensive formula is no longer available for \\xc2\\xa52,990 price is also available, which means compared to the DoCoMo packet rate it's double in total and the packet prices same with that of AU's. iPhone as I just demonstrated to you, gives you fun, more fun if you use it more. And you really want to play with it all the time and you'd like to use it for business as well. And we see data traffic increase. But from entry users' point of view maybe this \\xc2\\xa57,280 is too high and we get much reaction so it's not just for heavy users who are very keen to use iPhone, but even for the elderly or the kids. Because we hear much interest from them, because parallel game is available and we just made a demonstration as to what kind of functions are available. So we'd like to offer price plan, which can be accepted by more people and we'd like to become a lifestyle company in the 21st century. That's all from me. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " '2008 Q2': \"I'm Son from SOFTBANK. Good afternoon. As you aware, stock market in the world we've seen turmoil and also uneasiness towards the economies. So it's very much confusing situation. And under such circumstance, our stock price also having ups and downs. And the background of that I believe is because of the large debt in these financing. Okay can we pay the debt? Or because we don't disclose the business forecast so far, so in transparency of the future, those kind of considerations we believe is there amongst the investors in the market. So today we having earnings results announcement and after we start or launch the broadband, we never disclosed the business forecast for about seven to eight years, I believe. And this is a first time since then actually to disclose the business forecast for this fiscal year and the next fiscal year. And we have bring forward about a week for the announcement, so that we will be able to answer those questions about the results for the term. So that's why that we changed our schedule for a week to bring forward. So that -- in that same time to disclose the business forecast, to meet your expectation. Because there are in transparencies, so that's why that causing the uneasiness, and that's why that we decided to meet your expectations and answer your questions. Now, I'd like to go into the presentation. There are three highlights for the term, the first operating income \\xc2\\xa5180 billion year-on-year 7.3% up, which is the highest ever since foundation. And second point, as mentioned earlier, we have a large debt and that's why having some uneasiness in the market. But at this first half, in the previous first half we've been able to improve the free cash flow by \\xc2\\xa5238.9 billion. And the third point is the mobile business; we have been able to gain number one position for net addition for 17 consecutive months. So those are the three highlights we have for this term. Now going into the details, net sales, EBITDA, operating income, ordinary income and net income as you can see the figure is here on table. Net sales are -- looks like a little bit of decrease here, but because we have started the installment sales of the handset prior to the competitors in the market and the numbers of those installment has been finished the first round. And the upgrades of the handset number is decreasing a bit. Not only us, but also I believe that the same situation be seen in DoCoMo. I use a number of handset sold because we not only us also the competitors started two years contract, so the number of handsets sold is decreasing. So the net sales coming along with the net handset sales that portion is decreasing a bit, but other than that we have seen the increase. Number of handsets sold is decreasing, but number of customers increasing and number of upgrades are going down, meaning the positive for the management itself. So as a result, operating income and ordinary income showing a steady increase. Performance forecast. Last year's actual operating income 324.2 billion and free cash flow taking CapEx out is 164.2 negative figure. And for this fiscal year, however, for the first half of the fiscal year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but if this is the full year forecast for fiscal 2008 we expecting 340 billion, and we expecting about \\xc2\\xa5300 billion improvements in free cash flow to \\xc2\\xa5140 billion. And for the next fiscal year, operating income for fiscal year 2009 is \\xc2\\xa5420 billion. Operating cash flow \\xc2\\xa5500 billion and the CapEx or the investing cash flow \\xc2\\xa5250 billion. Therefore, free cash flow we expecting \\xc2\\xa5250 billion for fiscal 2009. So this will be \\xc2\\xa5110 billion improvement from the forecast of 2008. \\xc2\\xa5250 billion free cash flow to be piled up. Therefore this will be the source for the repayment of the debt, which means we have enough capability to pay down the debt. In the forecast of the free cash flow is shown in this chart, we seeing great improvement. Main portion come \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for this debt is coming from the loan for the acquisition of Vodafone KK, about \\xc2\\xa52 trillion acquisition we made for Vodafone KK. And capital we injected and also or some for the preferred stocks by Vodafone UK has been ejected. And the loan has been securitized and total amount was about \\xc2\\xa51.4 trillion. And the some hundreds of billions yen has been already repaid, and 140 to 250 free cash flow is to be expected. So with that will be used for the source of the payment of the debt. And the agreement we have with the bank's groups, a minimum amount to paying, there are several figures showing in the magazines since there are some violations of the terms. Those kind of news on the or the wrong information is on the magazine. However, this is totally wrong and actually minimum payment is the green line you can see on this chart and actuals forecast both are highly accelerated compared to the minimum line. And we expecting \\xc2\\xa5250 billion of the free cash flow, then this will be used and also be able to complete the payment of the debt within four to five to six years or so. So that we expecting the schedule bringing forward for the payment of the debt to complete. And consolidated net sales by segment, as you can see on the screen, mobile handset installment sales, this portion is showing negative. But revenue from the communication business and others are showing steady improvements. As a result, consolidated EBITDA in all segment year-on-year basis, we show -- we've seen the improvements. Operating income highest ever since the foundation. Ordinary income, as well highest ever, year-on-year basis this is the highest ever for the consolidated ordinary income of \\xc2\\xa5117.3 billion. Consolidated net income last year first half, we had temporal factors due to special income loss net and release of income tax payable at the subsidiary in US, which was \\xc2\\xa512.9 billion as a one-time profit, which is disclosed last year. And this kind of one-time thing will not happen every year. So if we take this one-time portion out, which is shown in blue portion from 33.4 to 37.3, so making improvements due to the -- on this chart as well, and the consolidated net income, on page 15, as you can see on the slide. Page 16, consolidated cash flow. As mentioned earlier, operating cash flow is showing steady improvement, and the CapEx too is reducing steadily. Therefore, free cash flow is increasing. Operating cash flow year-on-year basis for the first half comparison, last year first half was \\xc2\\xa50.4 billion and this fiscal -- first half \\xc2\\xa5177.2 billion, so making a steady improvement in operating cash flow as an actual. That is self-explanatory from this slide, and next. I'd like to talk about the important index for the free cash flow and capital expenditure. Those are loose end things decreasing from fiscal year 2005. For the first two, three years after the Yahoo! BB business started, we needed a big amount of capital expenditure, but from -- after that we have a steady decrease. And also we brought Japan Telecom, then, of course, we -- amount again needed a big capital expenditure for OTOKU Line and other things. But it again steadily decreasing. And when we bought Vodafone KK with small number of base stations, those are the bottlenecks therefore we accelerated the capital expenditure for the coming three years at that time. As I just explained it, at that time, and we did it, as we said. But the peak of the capital expenditure was over, so as you can see it here on this slide, capital expenditure is going down steadily. The actual cash flow number can be said EBITDA minus capital expenditure. So operating cash flow minus capital expenditure can be considered as a free cash flow and this number as you can see it here is steadily improving. Therefore we have a more free cash flow compiling. And this free cash flow as I just mentioned does not include capital I excuse interpreter that after the subtraction of capital expenditure and we have this \\xc2\\xa5238.9 billion improvement year-on-year. And \\xc2\\xa5300 billion as the cash -- free cash flow improvement is expected and we have already done this \\xc2\\xa5238.9 already. And I understand there were some concerns about our cash positions, that's because we have a big amount as the debt associated with the acquisition of Vodafone KK. So this was not really clear to the market. Therefore there was a concern, but we do have about the \\xc2\\xa5500 billion of affluent fund. And our bond schedule here as you can see it, for the second half this year \\xc2\\xa520 billion and excluding capital for the third quarter \\xc2\\xa520 billion and for the fourth quarter \\xc2\\xa550 billion for redemption of bond are needed. But next year for the first and second quarters redemption of bonds are zero. That's schedule of the bonds redemption. And in the third quarter and fourth quarter next year 45 billion and \\xc2\\xa550 billion are expected. And we have affluent funds of \\xc2\\xa5500 billion. Therefore, if you think about that source then the bond redemption will or should see any programs. In addition to this \\xc2\\xa5500 billion of cash position, as I just mentioned for this year alone we will have \\xc2\\xa5140 billion of free cash flow generating, and next year \\xc2\\xa5250 billion of free cash flow coming in. So if you add those numbers, 140 plus 250 and the existing \\xc2\\xa5500 billion. So 500 billion and 140 billion, 250 billion then it's about \\xc2\\xa5900 billion. And if you look at what we have to pay in the schedule is small amount, I think that's very easy to understand. And the interesting bearing debt status, as I just mentioned, the acquisition of Vodafone K.K. required \\xc2\\xa52 trillion, about \\xc2\\xa52 trillion and for that acquisition we had a temporary increase in debt. Now the redemption repayment of those debt is very smoothly going on. And equity ratio, EBITDA margin, debt equity ratio, net debt equity ratios, those are the major indexes. And as you can see it, all of them have been increased by more than 10%. It's just a matter of natural things, because we do have the increase in free cash flow and also income, therefore all those of major financial indices have to be improved. And if you look that EBITDA margin by segment, then a broadband infrastructure here, and mobile communications and the fixed line telecommunications, in all those segments we have improvement of EBITDA margin. And as the other day KDDI announced its result of the earnings, and they said they have several tens of billions in red for the fixed line. And I have heard that MTT has a same kind of a situation for the fixed line business. But our fixed line telecommunications now in black. And also the level of profit is increasing, so in all segments of communications businesses of ours are having better profitabilities, and they are being operated in very good manner. And next as I just mentioned a moment before, by 2018 we need to repay the debt incurred by the acquisition of mobile business, and as I just mentioned the pace of repayment has been accelerated. Associated with this acquisition as Vodafone KK, Vodafone -- the former Vodafone KK not SOFTBANK, but the Vodafone KK -- former Vodafone KK issued -- had issued bonds already, which amounted for \\xc2\\xa575 billion and those are in hands of many investors. And at the time of acquisition to buyback -- to redeem those older bonds -- at the time of acquisition was difficult because of the number of investors and bondholders. So there was a certain requirement that we have to have in substance redemption. So here's what we have done depositing the same amount of money or trust the same amount of money of \\xc2\\xa575 billion equal to this corporate bonds issued by the Vodafone KK was the way we had to do. So at that time when we acquired Vodafone KK, we trusted \\xc2\\xa575 billion cash. So we trusted -- we deposited. And at that time back then all of the mega banks in Japan had single A ratings. So from the accounting perspective, if we trusted \\xc2\\xa575 billion to those banks with single A rating, we were not good enough to have this in substance decisions at that time. That was quality accounting rule required. So, we had to deposit the money or trust the money to AA rated entities. And at that time we deposited this -- \\xc2\\xa575 billion, but now we see the credit crunch and market crunch and those negative factors impacted us. And there is a possibility that this \\xc2\\xa575 billion deposited might not be coming back to us. So that's means we may need to record special loss, so I'd like to disclose this information to you. At the moment of this portfolio has 160 entities of the listed companies or other banks or financial institutions. And out of 150 entities if six entities go through credit events then there will be no loss to us. So if the number of the credit events is six or lower then no loss. But after the seventh credit event and eighth credit event, we have to record special loss. At the moment we have been informed that there have been six credit events that means we do not have to record any loss, no loss. But if there will be any -- there will be seventh credit event or eighth credit event then we have to, at maximum, record \\xc2\\xa575 billion. So this is what I would like explicitly mention today. And when it comes to ninth credit event or tenth credit event then what will happen. We do not have to have any loss beyond \\xc2\\xa575 billion, so \\xc2\\xa575 billion is the maximum that is the ceiling. The former Vodafone KK had issued corporate bonds and we have to redeem that and we need to have credit support and actually that is already endorsed by the Mizuho Corporate Bank. And at the four clock from rating company, we are assured there is a no impact in a negative way to this rating. And that was at four o'clock right, yes, Moody's, at four o'clock today endorsed that there will be no negative impact to the rating of this corporate bonds. And I direct you also disclose this information to you. So here, there are three key points. At the moment, the number of defaults is six. That means we do not have to have any special loss. And other than this transaction, we do not have any similar type of transactions and this in sub sense decision was not done for mere investing. It was to arrange what was necessary at that time for corporate bonds which have been issued by the former Vodafone K.K. And if the loss incurs, the amount of the loss is limited because it is just a one-off time loss and we do not need to worry about the snowballing effect. And next I like talk about the business and our business is of course continuing. And first, net share of the timing loan, we acquired Vodafone K.K. Everybody talks about that we'll be the looser, but actually it was not, we are the winner. And when it was Vodafone K.K. if you compare our numbers to their number then you can see we have the steady growth in net additions. And there is also, if you look at the monthly revenue the subscriber we have a steadied the installment sale and we have segregated the ad charge and also the hardware, the handset cost. And we were the pioneer of this installment sale and now the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication have already guided the other two operators and those two operators are doing the same thing. So the average payment per subscriber monthly. In the first quarter it was the \\xc2\\xa55,570 and for this second quarter it was \\xc2\\xa55,720. So you can see it already hit the bottom. And for the future, as you can see from icon mobile phone is becoming more and more Internet machine then we can expect more and more data ARPU. As we can see from the previous chart, data ARPU revenue is increasing and this trend is going to be wider. And next is the Asia, Alibaba and the Alibaba 100% subsidiary Telbo . Telbo is something similar to Yahoo! auction in Japan and this time -- this state in China is one of the subsidiary of the Alibaba which is the B2B business of Alibaba. In the high expected business, is not the one that we already listed but unlisted Telbo is actually having high expectations for the future and this is going to be the main driver for the farther growth of the business. So Yahoo! in Japan, Alibaba in China, Sohu in China, those will be the showing more and more existence in Asian region. And the last, once again I would like to comment about the free cash flow. One year before annual basis \\xc2\\xa5160 billion free cash flow negative. This fiscal year expecting 140 billion positive and follow year \\xc2\\xa5250 billion. So we are expecting a great improvement for the free cash flow. And for your reference, 140 billion free cash flow compared to the other companies, it's around 16th ranking of the Top 20. And 250 will be within the Top 10 ranking of the free cash flow. Other than us something like a very traditional -- in the growth companies this here, as you can see, in those companies in Top 10 mainly for exports or the commodities, they maybe impacted from the current economy situation. But we rather be farther -- expecting the farther growth. So our free cash flow have three highlights, three points. First is that ours highly stable infrastructure business. Even having slumping economy, but the people -- doesn't mean that the people stop using mobile phone, stop talking over the phone. These past two months economy is -- situation in the world is turmoil. But the number of minutes of use or the frequency of calls we are -- I am checking everyday basis to see the usage, frequency of the customers but that doesn't change or doesn't decrease at all. So the basic communication tool is just speaking or communicating using the phone is not decreasing. It is actually showing a smooth progress, number of users increasing at the same time. So I -- we believe a stable cash flow -- free cash flow can be piled up for the coming year. And the second point is the high growth Internet business. And the third is Asia. We have high growth in Asia. So these three points. Internet, because we don't need much of the CapEx for internet business. So like Yahoo! Japan which is already a listed company doesn't -- did not recur much of the CapEx. So ordinary income, net income, those access is going to the -- free cash flow. So that we expecting enough cash flow to be piled up and at the same time having Internet business in Asia, which is -- which can expect the high growth. So those are the reason why that we have a strong confidence that we will be able to increase or improve the free cash flow level of ours. So, once again coming back to our business forecast which is the first time in seven to eight years. Operating income, operating cash flow, and free cash flow 140 for this fiscal year to 150 for next fiscal year that we would like to make sure that we will be able to realize. So it's now forecast it says here, but we've been even that we've been asked the forecast so many times, but never answered so far since now. And we were in a conservative position. So that we were taking a careful process and I thought that -- when we disclosed our forecast, we have to be very careful and also have to be confident. Then this time, it says forecast here but actually is very similar to the commitment. So that's how I feel to disclose this figure. That's all from me. Thank you very much. \",\n",
       " '2008 Q3': \"I am Son from SoftBank. Recently, global economy is in a really difficult situation. And today we made our earnings result announcement in SoftBank. And our mobile business, I believe that it was very good decision we made to launch the mobile business. That's how I feel right now. For the details, I will save it for the later but so far in summary I believe we are doing good progress so far. Actually, the pace and the progress is much better than we expected at the time of acquisition of the mobile Veeco. Now I would like to go into the presentation. First is the highlight. Operating income is actually highest ever. And second, fiscal year 2008 free cash flow forecast was made with \\xc2\\xa5140 billion for this fiscal year. And today we would like to revise upwardly to \\xc2\\xa5150 billion. Next slide shows the summary of consolidated earnings. As you can see our net sales, operating income, free cash flow these are the actuals we have. And going one-by-one, as I mentioned in the first slide in the previous an earnings result announcement we made a forecast of operating income with \\xc2\\xa5340 billion and 420 for fiscal 2009. In free cash flow, 140 for 2008 and 250 for fiscal year 2009 that was the announcement we made. And this time for the free cash flow of fiscal year 2008, we would like to revise from 140 to \\xc2\\xa5150 billion. For the fiscal year 2009, I would like to go into detail in a later slide. Now the consolidated earnings results for past nine months and compared to the previous year nine months shows in this slide and colored differently by segments, especially the mobile communications business. Looks like they are net sales decrease compared to the previously fiscal year nine months. But when we go into detail the handset sales has decreased. This is based on the decrease of shipment of handset. And this number of handsets shipments we have discounts based on the sales as on a monthly discount. So this is not something that we can make money by selling the handset. So it's not that we can make money from the handset selling, but telecom service revenue is the source of our revenue. In the these days we have been seen some declines in the telecom service revenue and that is due to offering the monthly discounts to the customers for using the installment program. But still this time we've been able to make increased trend for this telecom service revenue. So here that we be, we start seeing even under the monthly discount offering we start seeing this telecom service revenue increase, which we believe is the big turnover for the mobile business. So finally we start seeing the increase of this telecom service revenue. I would like to explain a little bit more detail in a separate slide. But the monthly discount provides 24 months free, but after that we don't provide any discounts. But still we'll be able to enjoy the customer base. So structurally we will be able to see the increase of telecom service revenue, which we believe is coming in fiscal year 2009. So finally we start seeing increase in telecom service revenue, which is the core of the core business of ours and that's the turnover points of the revenue. As I mentioned earlier starting from the third quarter, we start seeing the increase in telecom service revenue, until then due to those offerings including monthly discounts. That was decreasing. In the comparison with the competitors you can see competitors are suffering from the decline of the telecom service revenue on the other hand as the SoftBank is increasing. And because competitors don't offer something like monthly discount, but us are offering such service so that's we believe is one of the handicap. And we are about to mitigate this handicapped portion. So structurally we believe we believe we will be able to make a better profitabilities. Going to the EBITDA by segment. This is, we believe that we will be going to enter the more profitability is here especially in mobile communications. But I want you to look at other than mobile communications segment actually all those segments even excluding mobile communications is seeing the increase. And this is operating income, as you can see all the segments shows increase. After the acquisition of Japan Telecom, we've been seeing the negative figures in operating income for fixed-line telecommunications business. But this has been turned over and now that you can see the wider positive figures in fixed-line telecommunications. In the Mobile business, compared to the SoftBank consolidated and this shows the mobile communication segment. This is the consolidation from SoftBank, and that is what we disclose in earnings result announcement. But when it comes to SOFTBANK MOBILE, which is our wholly owned subsidiary, for example in NTT Group the great part is the holding consolidated figures from the holding company's perspective. From the DoCoMo's perspective, the one that actually operating business that will be seen in this blue line. So mobile business itself, how we can tell is that business is actually making money or not. But in the case of the NTT Group rather than seeing from the holding company's point of view, better to see from the DoCoMo's point of view than that we will be able to tell the real situations of the mobile business. So from that sense, we show this blue line as a SOFTBANK MOBILE consolidated. And you can tell that it is making better figures, and the revenue increased by 7.6%. And consolidation investment shown in the slide, amortization of goodwill, variance of depreciation those are the adjusting items. But if you want to see the real situation in business as I mentioned earlier in the previous page, the blue line can tell you the real situation in the business, which is the SOFTBANK MOBILLE itself for past nine months with \\xc2\\xa5146.8 billion of operating income. Next is the consolidated ordinary income. Last year because we had a one-time gain due to IPO by Alibaba.com Limited, it's not because we're sell it, but that it was assumed gain along with the IPO of Alibaba.com Limited. So it was clearly disclosed, how much was the amount for the one-time gain due to the IPO of Alibaba.com and which was included in the ordinary income. And even we exclude that but still we believe we're making a smooth progress here. In the consolidated net income, this too had one-time gain due to IPO of Alibaba.com Limited in previous term. So even if we exclude that but still we're making a smooth and steady increase here. Net income, consolidated net income is as you can see in page 18. In operating cash flow, there are several way of seeing an accounting like US-GAAP or Japan-GAAP. So there are some difference in between. And that depends how you valuate the things. But the most important fact is the cash flow I believe. And from that sense even under such difficult situation in global economy I believe that the cash flow or the cash is becoming, receiving a highest interest and this time we are able to improve by \\xc2\\xa5213.5 billion year-on-year. Free cash flow has improved drastically, \\xc2\\xa5260 billion improvement we made. On annual basis, we said \\xc2\\xa5150 billion for the fiscal year 2008. We made for the upward revision. And the important figure for the free cash flow here is a CapEx, and CapEx you can tell that we picked out completely and now that we making more efficiency in CapEx. Interest-bearing debt and this slide shows the interest-bearing debt by segment. And this slide shows the corporate bonds redemption schedule for two years and seven months. A redemption schedule shows in this slide. And because we have enough cash position with us, total of \\xc2\\xa5423.3 billion so there is no problem at all for the redemption of the bonds. Next is the SOFTBANK MOBILE debt status with the bank groups. We have a minimum commitment with them and the payment schedules are committed with them which shows in the green line. In reality as you can see in the pink arrow, we making acceleration of the repayment. So we making front-headed payments. It has been made. Quarterly basis we may disclose the actual figures that we've been repaid so far. As you can tell we are repaying ahead of schedule. Next is the financial indexes. In all the key financial indexes we've been making an improvement. And EBITDA margin by segment, this too in all the segments. EBITDA margin has been improved. In addition in the previous earnings result announcement, we made announcement regarding in-service redemption before maturity of bonds issued by former Vodafone K.K. And since then, we don't see any changes after the announcement of earnings results for second quarter. And we don't in any situation why we need to record any loss. So as for the situation of risks, there were no changes made. And as for the credit rating as you can see it here, our credit rating is also being improved. Then next fiscal year 2009 forecast. At the last time of the announcement of earnings, we have released forecast for the first time in many years. And it was not only for this fiscal year, but it was also aggressively forecasted for fiscal year 2009. And \\xc2\\xa5150 billion of free cash flow is listed here. And how can we achieve that? How can we achieve the improvement of the operating income by \\xc2\\xa580 billion? I'd like to elaborate on that. Recently it's not news to hear any downgrade revision of forecast. But in our case, we are going forward very positively, and for the next fiscal year we have a great confidence in our free cash flow. And I'd like to talk about the reason behind. And for the operating income, we expect \\xc2\\xa580 billion increase. And why is that? First is telecom service revenue increase. Sales growth and revenue growth, those are very important factors. And we expect we will have telecom service revenue increased by 60 billion and the cost reduction by 40 billion. So I just mentioned is that increase or decrease in terms of the SoftBank consolidated earning results? It actually depends on how you say it, from which angle you say it. And the Mobile business has shown increase, as I just reported. But from a different angle of the consolidated figures, there might be some people who doubt it. But regardless the opinions, our Mobile business will have \\xc2\\xa5100 billion increase. That is a \\xc2\\xa560 billion and \\xc2\\xa540 million, which are listed here on this chart. And other than mobile businesses, we forecast \\xc2\\xa520 billion increase. And in total it will be \\xc2\\xa5120 billion. But I do hate excusing myself. Therefore, here is a buffer included that is \\xc2\\xa540 billion. So as I just mentioned \\xc2\\xa580 billion increase in operating income. This is very much confident figure. Because we do have this \\xc2\\xa540 billion buffer internally so as our top management \\xc2\\xa580 billion increasing operating income is something we will be able to achieve without making any excuses. And behind this confidence there is this buffer. And as for free cash flow, about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion upward revision is already included here. And from this \\xc2\\xa5150 billion upwardly revised figure, we also have \\xc2\\xa5100 billion increase to \\xc2\\xa5250 billion. And first operating income increase is the biggest contribution. And why is that? Because we will have \\xc2\\xa580 billion increase in operating income. Therefore, we will have this \\xc2\\xa580 billion increase here. Operating income we will increase by \\xc2\\xa580 billion, and whose breakdown was just elaborated. And other than that more efficient CapEx and other impact will give us \\xc2\\xa520 billion. So in total \\xc2\\xa5100 billion increase in free cash flow. And \\xc2\\xa580 billion out of this \\xc2\\xa5100 billion includes \\xc2\\xa540 billion of buffer as I just explained. So this improvement by \\xc2\\xa5100 billion in free cash flow is something we are really confident in achieving. So let me elaborate once again \\xc2\\xa560 billion increase in telecom service revenue and cost reduction of 40 billion. And number of mobile we will have \\xc2\\xa520 billion increase and buffer has the \\xc2\\xa540 billion, so in total it's \\xc2\\xa580 billion. So telecom service revenue increased by \\xc2\\xa560 billion is something I'd like to talk about in more detail. Why \\xc2\\xa560 billion increase is expected? There are three big points: First is a number of subscribers. It has been increasing and that impact will come to on annual basis. And the second is the monthly discounts. We give monthly discounts to customers and the customers who will see the end of monthly discounts period is coming up. And there are many customers who are out of the period of monthly discounts. That is one thing. And the third is data ARPU increase. The source for the telecom service revenue increase is the customer base. So the increase in customer base is very important. I'd like to talk about more those three items. The first is a telecom service revenue increase. At the time of acquisition, we had about 15 million subscribers of which 1.6 million prepaid existed, which was colored in light blue here. And those prepaid customers contribution to revenue, the income was really limited. And the portion is going down. You can see the number is going down. And this is actually intentional move. And the chunk which gives us good revenue, it's shown in purple here so that is our general customers. In other words, it's a postpaid customers. And we have increase of 5.5 million of postpaid customers. And so far, we were giving monthly discounts to those customers, and the number of the customers was increasing, but we are giving discounts. Therefore, it might be understood that our business was growing, but it wasn't generating cash. But actually many customers are going to get out of the discount period. So the increase in number of customers will have a direct impact to our income. So the increase in income in SOFTBANK MOBILE business is now seeing a turning point. So this is actually a very important message today. That is a change of the tide. So along with the number increase in the subscription, lower churn rate is a very important factor. At the time of acquisition of Vodafone K.K., actually these 3G customers, two point something percent, it was a little bit below 3% was leaving us every month. So it had a bad reputation. Two point something percent monthly means about 30% annually so one out of three customers will just leave us. That was the situation at that time. But for the last three years, it was greatly improved. And recently 3G customers' churn rate is 0.69% as small as this. And maybe you can see there is a little increase in second quarter, and there was a question about that if this trend would go on or not. And I said that this is just a one-time impact. And I said, please wait for the numbers coming after the close of third quarter, so here is the outcome. So in the last quarter, it was just a one-off bad churn rate. But it's going down as you can see it here, and the decrease is very steady. And after the 24 month of installment, there might be a big churn coming. That was actually asked as a question. But you can see, it was started in a pilot case in 2006 in September. And in October we have started in full-fledged manner so that means we already have customers who are out of the installment period. But still the churn rate is improving, so there was certain questions about the churn rate surge after the 24 month of installment. But to that concern, here is an answer that it was not the case, and you can see it from the number here. And why the number of sales of handsets is dropping? Here this is actually the information, which is disclosed for the first time, and very important information. At the time when we acquired Vodafone K.K., per customer on average the handset tenure was 24 months, and last year it was at 28 months after starting installment sale. And finally now it's 39 months. We have introduced installment sale, and I believe this is the first business model in the world, which was installed by SoftBank. While the other two competitors have started installment sale, but if it were possible, then I would like to apply for patent of business model. So as a mobile operator, this change in the business model contributed to betterment of the management. For three or six or maybe for twelve months, customers used their handset and then they just changed to another handset. And operators used to subsidize almost all the cost of handset. So the especially younger customers upgrade their handsets so often. So the handsets tenure on average was very short. But this two-year installment sale was introduced, and the average handset tenure has been prolonged up to 39 months. I do not expect it will be switched to 45 months or longer, but it will be around 30 something months. That will be rather steady numbers in the future as well. But actually this 39 month is longer than I expected as a handset tenure, and that gives us a great impact to our management. And what is that? So page 43. So far, the Y-axis on this graph shows the communication charge, and that was 5,300 or \\xc2\\xa55,400. And on average customers use one handset for 24 month so that was already elaborated on the previous page. So it was 24 months on average as the handset tenure. But along with introduction of installment sale, we started monthly discounts for sales promotion. So on average \\xc2\\xa51,600 discount was given to customers as monthly discount. And the period was 24 months. So this is sales promotion. So for 24 months customers on installment, and we provide special discounts, which is monthly discount. And after 24 months actually in average last year the average tenure became from 24 to 28 months. So in between 24 months to 28 months, we don't have to provide any discounts. And with this today's announcement with the latest information, in average the tenure has been became longer to 39 months. So the period we don't have to provide any discounts, it's becoming longer by 15 months, which is good element for us to improve our revenues structurally. So after this December or after this January, these customers are increasing risk that there could be some questions that those customers made churn on us, but actually as you can tell from the pervious pages that the churn rate is not increasing. So along with telecom service revenue, we believe that we will be able to improve the telecom service revenue structurally, not a one-time. The competitors announcing that their telecom service revenue is decreasing. But actually in our side, we are saying that we are going to improve here. Because so far we've been having some disadvantage of providing this monthly discounts to the customers. But with some customers' maturity of monthly discounts that we believe, we will be able to improve this revenue structurally. And the second element is the cost reduction by \\xc2\\xa540 billion in mobile business. And the breakdown of that \\xc2\\xa540 billion, we have three points. One is the handset related cost reduction. Second is the doubtful accounts improvement. Third is other cost reduction through synergies, among three telecommunication companies like we have Yahoo! BB, broadband and fixed-line telecommunications. So three fixed cost we believe we'll be able to see some synergies from that to the cost reduction. Handset related cost reduction includes some reasonable handset line up. And the second because of this economic situation, customer's not only pursuing for the high-end function handset but some customers are seeking for some simple handset, which does not prefer any high functions. With that we'll be able to reduce the purchase cost of the handset. In the synergies here, not only our three telecommunications companies and also there are some other consideration we have for the doubtful accounts coming from the fraud use of the handset. And there are some considerations on that, and we'd like to forecast on that explanation here from this side. Because customer do not have to pay any money at the time of the shop, they bring back the handset and that was the first time in the industry that we made such business model. So customer will be able to bring their handset back without paying anything so the hurdle became lower for those customers. So there are some cases that people illegally purchase the handset and do not pay anything. So those bad guys, this was the very good target and very good business model. So there are some cases where the SoftBank was targeted. So here is as it says a short-term churn. It was almost close to 100,000 of those short-term churn. Here we referring to short-term churn if those customers who leave our network within less than six months. So even they have outstanding balance and they have outstanding installment payments but leaving the network. As a result we saw those customers are fraud use of the customers. Even that we increased customers but those are meaningless. So the short-term churn though most of the customers do not pay us. Of course not all of them, some of them did have a good reason to leave the network. So even that they leave the network but still pay all the debt. And that number is also including here but most of the part I say is the customers not paying us. And since last July, we start very strict control for contracting the customers with the strict screening. And if customer do not pass the screening, we don't really connect the network for those customers. And even the customer prefer to pay for the bank transfer, but we made sure to have their own sale. Because before not only us but other competitors has failed that they didn't ask customers to bring their sale to contract with the bank account transfer. But we start to make the control strict, more strict. And we became the hardest, harder for the new contract. And I saw competitors start their own instrument program as well. So we believe that there will be some risk for the outstanding balance. So other competitors may start to enhance the strict control on the new contract. And because we experienced a little bit earlier than them so we made a strict control here. And as you can see in the slide, there about \\xc2\\xa510 billion loans for doubtful accounts needed to be recorded in some quarter. These are the cost that we incur in our conservative point of view in every month basis. Competitors, they just started the installment program. So I believe they will start cumulating their allowance for doubtful account. But because we experienced a little bit early so we had strong regret, and we made a stronger screening on the contract. And have some disadvantage ahead, but with those initiatives we were able to decrease the allowance for doubtful account down to \\xc2\\xa5300 million. So we are able to bring this figure down to \\xc2\\xa5300 billion. So even that we provide allowance for doubtful account, but we were able, some case that we're able to receive or collect those bad debts from the customers in the case that we reverse of those allowance for doubtful accounts, which has shown in the line above \\xc2\\xa51.6 billion. So allowance is something that we provide for the estimated cost. But in this case, we received or we're able to collect it with \\xc2\\xa51.6 billion. So as a result in total \\xc2\\xa5300 million for the doubtful accounts expense. And I believe that that this will be around 1 to \\xc2\\xa52 billion. But this third quarter because we had reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts so it was too good to be true, but we believe that compared to those \\xc2\\xa510 billion, it's really a good. If we try to make this zero, it's too hard for customers. Even that the good customers we have to reject so we try to see some buffer there. And still that we were able to improve drastically. So cost reduction as I mentioned earlier those three points: handset related cost reduction and the doubtful accounts improvement and the cost reduction through three telecommunication companies synergies. In some \\xc2\\xa520 billion of non-mobile, and we see some buffers if it \\xc2\\xa540 billion. Because I don't like excuses, I mentioned earlier. But this is a commitment as a management, it is not that \\xc2\\xa5120 billion but \\xc2\\xa580 billion. So even we see some reduction there, but our commitment is the \\xc2\\xa580 billion here. Depending on the items or accounts that we may have some ups and down. But commitment from the management is the \\xc2\\xa580 billion of the operating income increase, and we are quite confident in this number. Now I'd like to go into the mobile business. In page 53, we've been not only working on to increase the customer base, but at the same time encourage customers to use longer with longer tenure. So that a customer will stay with us longer period or at the same time we have enhanced screening system so that we'll be able to not only focus on the acquisition but try to have a longer period of usage. In annual basis, the net addition's share became 54%, in absolute figure 2.38 million. At the time of Vodafone Japan, it shows in red and after, become SoftBank you can see in gray bars. So it clearly tells you that we be making expansion of customer base. And one of the important element to contribute to this expansion of the customer base is the advertisement. In TV commercials, it was a first time of ours to advertise SoftBank group after we've launched the mobile business. So this was the first experience of ours to advertise the SoftBank group. So there are a lot of things that we didn't know how to do. But still we were able to win, won the high preference in TV commercial since January 2008 towards December 2008. So from January to December continuously that we were able to won the high preference spike brand. Which was I believe was a first time ever since these data has been collected. We have a quite dark in the sisters, brothers, family members, white families that very much appreciate those of them to contribute to this high preference in TV commercial. So we have the total monthly payments per users, which divide or unbundled the handset payment in the communication charges. This green portion and the purple portion and the yellow portion, those three altogether is the actual payment we will receive from the customer. So that's from my perspective, that's the actual ARPU we receive. And 5,430 is the bottom at the some total monthly payment, and I have been receiving comments that this amount would be going down. But actually as we can see it's steadily increasing. Now it's 5,770 but so far monthly discounts have been given. So basic charge for voice and data revenue are going down. That was what they pointed out. But from a fiscal year 2009, there will be more customers after the installment appeared which means the discount period of 24 months. So purpose and revenue and those are the total monthly payment per user will be increasing. There are two important things. One is the customers will get out of the period of monthly discount and also data ARPU is going up. And for longer perspective how much the data ARPU is going to increase is the biggest key to mobile business and the data ARPU is elaborated on page 58. Before our acquisition, when it was a Vodafone K.K., data ARPU increase was smallest among the three players. So the growth in data ARPU was slowest among the three. After it has become SoftBank, I declared that we will use Yahoo!, and we will provide a good content service. And as Internet company with pride we will raise this data ARPU so that was already announced. And last year was a first year of Internet machine of mobile phone. So as we can see it here the three-year trend, now finally SoftBank's growth in data ARPU is fastest. Far beyond other two players so that's where we are. But this is not the limit. How can we grow further? I would like to talk about this. As I just mentioned, last year from the beginning of last year even before iPhone announcement, I already declared that the year of 2008 will become the first year of Internet machine. When you look back at the year of 2008 in many years, people would remember the year as the first year of mobile Internet machine. And that was even before iPhone release, even before announcement of iPhone release. And at that time it was not really decided that SoftBank would be the operator to release iPhone in Japan. And I was, we were together with Sharp and introduce the full keyboard mobile handset Internet machine and after that the line-up has become bigger and bigger. And plus we introduce iPhone to the market compared to the other handset. Well this is first time to mention here. But compare to other handset iPhone uses data traffic use is ten times bigger than users of other handset. So on average, users of iPhone compared to users of other handset use the data traffic for the use of the information is ten times bigger. It's not the data ARPU because they are on our packet flat rate so there is a ceiling. But if you look at the traffic volume, then it's ten times bigger. And other handsets are going to become like iPhone. And SoftBank is very keen or keenest in Internet mobile. So SoftBank is sure that SoftBank will raise the data ARPU and the data use. And from now on what kind of initiatives we are going to place for data ARPU increase. First is Widget, actually there are two points. And at the last time, Mobile Widget was announced. And what's happened after that? And the second thing is S-1 Battle. This is a SoftBank user's exclusive service. This is exclusively prepared for SoftBank users. This is a video content. Among young women, the entertainment or comedy entertainment is the most popular content in terms of video content on mobile phone and for young men as well. But for young women, the comedy entertainment is the most popular content. And it's not just about iPhone. But other handsets can be used just like iPhone, and we introduced, we announced that we will introduce Mobile Widget and we started. And number of Widget was 100 at the time of start. KDDI and NTT DoCoMo have smaller number, 70 and 50 respectively. And two months after that ours is 140 and other two players not really growing. Our handset is more fun and more useful, and all of the handsets are becoming like iPhone. So this Mobile Widget has a key for that trend. We have already experienced a handset like iPhone. Therefore, we can be more eager and more serious about Widget. And we are an Internet company, therefore we are keener in Mobile Widget. And what is Widget? When you are using mobile phone, and you'd like to see the share quotes or like to access Mixi or Mobango or to see weather forecast, then you have to keep clicking the button to reach what you want, maybe after three or five clicks. Then you can finally get the weather forecast or share quotes or Mobango or Mixi. That is how you are what you are experiencing. But with this Widget on your mobile phone and on your standby screen that means when you open your handset then you will see this standby screen and on that screen already there are your local weekly forecast of weather today, tomorrow or maybe share quotes at the moment is already available. So just open it, then just one touch will bring you to Mixi or Mobango or to Yahoo! Auction. Very easier, that's how the Widget works. So Widget will be placed on the standby screen, and the information is updated all the time. So it's more convenient for customers, and the customers can use it more often and more quickly. So mobile phone will become more like Internet machine. So the use of the information will get bigger, which will result in bigger data use. And structurally, we'd like to aggregate Widget more and more, and we prepare Widget platform. And SoftBank or manufacturers Sharp, Matus, Panasonic or Toshiba, those hardware manufacturers have to develop very complicated software. Then it is very costly and it's not really well accepted by customers. But now software creators or content creators will become Widget creators with our platform. So on that platform people can create Widget. But the number of customers of entity DoCoMo is bigger. So from the point of view of Widget creators, entity DoCoMo might be a better candidate. I think that's a general view. But there are two reasons I can say no to it. Why we can motivate Widget creators to produce Widget to SoftBank before NTT DoCoMo. Because number of Widget by SoftBank is growing faster than other two companies. That's because SoftBank is an Internet company. So creators of applications for the Internet and creator's mindset is really well understood by us. So we have designed the platform as creator friendly. Under the name of the pride of SoftBank as an Internet company, we have provided the best environment for Widget creators to create Widgets. That is a first thing. And the second, but still if you look at the number of the customer base, because Widget creators are interested in the volume, then the number one is NTT DoCoMo, the second is KDDI and the third is SoftBank. There is a common view among general Widgets creators. And as a platform for Widget, yes the SoftBank is number three in terms of the number in Japan, but in the world it's number one. Why is that? SoftBank, China Mobile and Vodafone have formed a joint venture in October last year. So three months ago from now. And we have concluded the frame of the agreement. And next week in Barcelona, two heads of the two operators and myself we will meet. And actually once in two or three months we meet. And the number of the users of these three operators was 700 million last year. And the other day, I once counted then the number of the subscribers of three operators, subscribers mean who pay to us reached one billion. In Japan, SoftBank might not be a good candidate for providing Widget because it only has 20 million subscribers. So this 20 million in Japan is the possible or potential customers for Widget. But it's not just 20 million. If you look at the world, then the one billion will be in target. So in Japan, yes SoftBank is on numbers three but in the world it has or it shares one billion subscribers. That is the biggest chunk of subscribers in the world. And so in November last year so three months ago, I explained this logic to Widget creators and they actually were impressed. So they understood that SoftBank would be the best candidate for providing their Widgets. One another thing is the collaboration with Yoshimoto Kogyo, which is only available for SoftBank handsets. So high quality and only one click that you'll be able to enjoy, and this will be send via email. And you will be to see the clear image of the video streaming. Every morning you receive a mail only for those customers are requested among the SoftBank handset users. So for those SoftBank users of course terminate that you need to be subscribing the packet flat otherwise it's very much costful for customer as well. So for those customers subscribing packet flat then that and if you ask for it even more those customers without 1-Seg function because once it is quite recent trend, so there are some existing customers who has handset without the 1-Seg function but still you will be able to enjoy this video. So this mail will be send to you every morning, and the content is called S-1 Battle. This is the first in the world initiatives I believe. And this last week we had announcement for the new handsets. And at that time, we also touched down this S-1 Battle having the comedian from Yoshimoto Kogyo, so also wanted to see the video clip. [Company Video] The reason why the comedian saying this is S-1 Battle is great is because there are some comedian competition, but the award is about \\xc2\\xa510 million. And this competition is held only once a year, but this competition S-1 Battle will be held every month so in total it's going to be \\xc2\\xa5100 million or more. So such comedy entertainment can be seen, and you have one pair. So two competition, one competitions among two people or two groups will be held. So very small within three minutes video will be seen and it's competing each other. Anybody will be able to vote, which one was better. So if you vote for the one then that you will be able to vote for this person. And the other competition there are some only the some person will be able to vote, but this time that you will be able to vote and each one of you will have one vote and if you prefer to vote two then that you have, you may have to buy, have two SoftBank handset and that's also welcome as well from our point of view. So anyone be able to vote for any a comedy entertainment that you like. And in the last run, the grand champion will be made with the TV broadcasting in the \\xc2\\xa5100 million will be award for champions who win the championship game there. So far this type of competitions only the award \\xc2\\xa510 million or so, but at this time the S-1 Battle Grand Championship Battle will be awarding with \\xc2\\xa5100 million. So from the comedian's point of view, any special punch line or any special work that they may want to save for the S-1 Battle because the award is 10 times as much of compare to the others competitions. So I believe that this award has to be motivating enough for those comedians otherwise this will not be interesting. And of course the general audience may have some work as well, but with those professional comedians seriously compete each other to win the game. Even internally \\xc2\\xa5100 million award can be too expensive so such a discussion was also held. But what I said there was that when you see the professional golf game or any car racing game, usually award is about \\xc2\\xa5100 million or so. Compared to that comedy entertainment is also one of the art. Even comparing to sport or to the others, comedy never be inferior to the others. I believe that the comedy entertainment is one of the most very important art as well. Comedians putting an every effort to come to their work. So I highly evaluate those work and that's why that we came to this conclusion to award \\xc2\\xa5100 million for the championship winner. So this is unique content, and we believe this can make mobile handset more fun, more convenient. So news, share price, direct informations, anythings that can be available with one click to Yahoo!. And also you receive such video via mail every morning if you ask for. So this is something exclusive to SoftBank not only the hardware or not only pricing structure. Of course those are the efforts that we keep making, but on top of that we will like to make SoftBank handsets special, more fun and more convenient. Those evolution that we would like to pursue. So in summary, with the pride of the Internet company, we will like to offer a very special content or a very special service to the customers because of SoftBank handset or SoftBank service. So we, I say, I call it the first year of Internet content. 2008 was the first year of Internet machine, but the 2009 that I call it the first year of Internet content. So any video, any fun can be offered from SoftBank. Once again, I would like to summarize and confirm it you the 2008 consolidated earnings forecast. Free cash flow, we raised from \\xc2\\xa5140 billion to \\xc2\\xa5150 billion for fiscal year 2008 free cash flow. Fiscal year 2009, 420 for operating income and 250 for free cash flow. So 420 for operating income and \\xc2\\xa5250 billion for free cash flow. This is from my intuition amongst all the listed company in Japan this can be in the top ten of the companies in Japan. I believe this can be around top five or top six or so. SoftBank has been saying Internet and everything seems like very risky, and you may say that the operating cash flow is not generating or free cash flow isn't generating that kind of consideration has been made so far towards us I believe. But I say operating income of SoftBank, and the free cash flow after tax from any angle even under the such tough situation in global economy, I'm confident in these two figures for fiscal year 2009 to achieve. And I would like to compliment those figures as on management of the SoftBank. And I say this is not the onetime income, but I would like to keep this trend to five to ten years. It's not something like just a one time thing; it doesn't include something like that one-off gain or anything like that. But I still see five years later or ten years later still able to sustain. And that sustainable business model that we've been running then I believe such structure has been accomplished. Thank you very much. That's all from my presentation.\",\n",
       " '2008 Q4': \"I am Son. Thank you very much for coming to this meeting despite your busy schedule. Today, now I am going to explain the earning results, and since the acquisition of Vodafone K.K., that was a huge acquisition of a company, will be our biggest ever. And since then the market has been speculating that SoftBank had made a too risky bid, and that was rather repeated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 repeatedly asked question. And we, of course, understood there was risk, but we wanted to try and today at this see the entrance to the mobile industry and mobile internet after this acquisition and also the financing we made for the acquisition are now very certain to be rewarded and repaid, and that is going to be clearly declared today. That is the gist of today's presentation. Let me explain the earning result now. There are three highlights. First one, we had record profit for fourth consecutive years, and operating income was over \\xc2\\xa5350 billion. And also, the net additions of mobile achieved number one position for two consecutive years. And then number three, as I just mentioned, acquisition of a company using cash has some cases around the world including Japan, and Europe and the United States, but our case was the second biggest one, which was about \\xc2\\xa52 trillion. And of course in the history of the acquisition in Japan, it was the biggest, and our first exclusive acquisition. Although, the fund we procured will be repaid with our free cash flow, including this year and for the coming two years. And we expect, we will be able to have \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of free cash flow including this year and for two coming years. And here you can see on this slide, the summary of earnings. And I would like to elaborate on the details of each item. First of all, we actually revised our forecast of earnings three times, and every time we upgraded the revised sum and we all achieved- and \\xc2\\xa5350 billion was the latest forecast and we actually achieved \\xc2\\xa5351 billion, and there is therefore the free cash flow. We actually adjusted the forecast last month \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this month. And also, we exceeded the forecast of 170 and we achieved \\xc2\\xa5181 billion. So, it's just like the Olympian, Mr. Bubka, he made world record every time he jumped. So, we made a three time adjustment in our region as the forecast and we all exceeded all those forecasts. And this year, fiscal year 2009, in October last year we actually made an announcement of earnings forecast that included this year's forecast as well. And those numbers we announced at that time have been going very well. Therefore, we expect the \\xc2\\xa5420 billion of operating income and \\xc2\\xa5250 billion of free cash flow for this fiscal year are the ones we will be able to achieve and we believe we will do so. And I'd like to look back our history for the last 10 years. In 1995, we declared SoftBank will become an Internet company. So, at that time, we did not care much about the sales or the profit, but we knew that would be the one-in-a-century revolution and that revolution is intellectual revolution for the human being. Therefore, for the first ten years we shouldn't care about the revenues or sales, but rather we should focus on the growth of the business model and to promote it in Japan and in other countries around the world. And the Internet speed really to be fast, that's why we made effort in the field of broadband. So, just a couple of years ago we buy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a couple of years ago, we understood that our stage was a power investment stage. And now as you know, the world is facing the deteriorating economiceconomy and that is once-in-a-century, but still we think this is right opportunity to seize. So, we will work on broadband, internet and the mobile will become mobile internet, and those are the focuses we made efforts in. So, as you know, we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 net sales and EBITDA both are growing very well. EBITDA here, as you can see, just five or six years ago, EBITDA \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even EBITDA was in the negative territory, we were struggling at that time, but finishing the investment here. Now, we can see the operating income, as we can see it on the chart, we made a V-shape turnaround and we made a record profit. So, fiscal year 2008, we had \\xc2\\xa5359.1 billion of operating income and we believe that we will be able to have \\xc2\\xa5420 billion of operating income for fiscal year 2009. And the breakdown here, this is net sales segment, which is on page 12. And net sales for the last one year, there is a slight dent. And there is one single reason for that. We had there, mobile phone sales dropped for the last year. Mobile phone, which is the hardware with the mobile service, doesn't bring us the revenue just because they are selling, but margin as the handset per unit, somehow gives us a rather regulatory effect, if you just include all those commissions you pay to the agent. So, if customers change their handset by three months or six months and this is rather unique to the Japanese market, and we actually change that to installment sale. Therefore, most of the customers are using one single handset for 24 months or longer, so they have a longer tenure of one handset. That's why the volume of handsets sold is declining, and this is not as of our expectation. We did have an intension to change that business model into that shape, so it just worked as we expected and as we intended. So, associated with the decline in sales of handset is actually incorporated in our plan, but more importantly, the telecom service revenue, which brings us our profit; that is more important to us. So, if we see drop in telecom service revenue, then from a longer term perspective that is very negative, but we had rather fierce competition of price dropping. But now we are at the stage that we have increased the telecom service revenue. So, from the fiscal year 2006 to 2007, we had various discounts including monthly discounts and other fierce competition in prices, but for the fiscal year 2008, the telecom service revenue has grown year-on-year. And we also achieved the consecutive net addition number one, so that is a fruit out of that. And page 15, talks about the comparison with our competitors. The telecom service revenue, the most important revenue for operators and KDDI has a negative growth, and it's just a negative 1.8% year-on-year, and NTT DoCoMo also has a negative growth of 7.8%, and we are the only one among the three operators in the market who achieved the black number in this growth 1.4%. And then next is EBITDA per segment. In all segments, we have achieved a growth of EBITDA. And also, as I just mentioned, operating income \\xc2\\xa5420 billion is expected to be achieved for this year. And the mobile segment, if we talk about here, consolidated earnings result from accounting point of view from a- mobile communication segment has a slight dent in operating income. But if you look at the SoftBank mobile, which is the operator of the mobile business, has as 17% increase in operating income. So, the SoftBank mobile consolidated and mobile communication segment are impacted by the adjustments based on the consolidation. So, it's just like the NTT group's case. So, when it is looked from the holding company of NTT group, they have to include amortization of goodwill or other things associated with the acquisition in our case. And in NTT Group's case, DoCoMo part is equivalent to our SoftBank mobile. And in its operation, as you know, we have achieved consecutive number one in net additions. We have efficient management, so we had 70% increase in operating income of Softbank Mobile. In short, that is a big time we show in page 20, goodwill, amortization, variance of depreciation and others. And next is ordinary income in page 21. Fiscal year 2007, because our affiliate Alibaba.com Limited listed in Hong Kong stock exchange and we had a one-time gain. It's not the real sales, but along with this IPO, we have the one-time gain of \\xc2\\xa557.2 billion. So, if we exclude this one-time gain, you will be able to see the substantial capabilities of company. As you can see, the ordinary income is increasing trend. In the net income, \\xc2\\xa543.1 billion. As we announced the other day, in the fourth quarter we had approximately \\xc2\\xa575 billion special loss occurred due to the before \\xe2\\x80\\x93 due before the maturity assumption which was issued at the time of Vodafone K.K., and this was the bond issued by Vodafone K.K. And to redeem before the maturity, we had to recognize this special loss as a one-time loss of \\xc2\\xa575 billion. As a result, we had \\xc2\\xa544.4 billion in negative impact to our net income, but still we were expecting the positive figure for the net income. And whilst not really on the edge of the positive number, but we were able to achieve this \\xc2\\xa543.1 billion of net income even after the special loss. For fiscal year 2009, we don't expect any of the special loss. Also, we will have steady and gradually increase in net income for fiscal year 2009. And here in the page 23, ordinary income and before the tax you can see on page 23. And the next is the interest-bearing debt status. Here, we have \\xc2\\xa5240 billion and you will see from 400 billion, so for the net interest bearing debt \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion. So, this debt is decreasing steadily, which can be also seen in the page 26. Handset, as I mentioned earlier, there are some customers try to switch the handset one after another, which is quite unique for of Japanese market and to solve this issue, we started introducing the installment receipt program for the handset sales. This is the one that we receipt customers for the handset portion. Including that, that we have our net interest bearing debt, and including that, that we have \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion of net interest bearing debt, and as you can see on this slide, we have been decreasing compared to a year ago or two years ago. In the redemption schedule, our corporate bonds is seen in page 27, on the right hand side in the bar graph, 45 billion, 19, 20, those are there, but on your left is the- //our cash position in hand or the liquidity, or the unused portion of credit line facility. So including those, we have about \\xc2\\xa5480 billion of liquidity with us. So, we have enough fund to do the repayment in any case, which is clear from this slide. As mentioned, there are about close to 2 trillion yen acquisition by cash, usually these are not used \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our cash is not used for acquisition, but mainly issuing a new share. But in our case, we wanted to make sure, and that we had the confidence to succeed this business, and to try not to dilute the share of the shareholders. So that's why that we decided. The acquisition by loan is cash, so once we were able to repay the loan then- that I believe this will be the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 best option for the shareholders. And from the sales that we've/will been having a steady repayment of the loan, which is seen in this slide on page 28. Page 30, after the acquisition with cash, we had a one-time deterioration of the- our financial position, but now it has been turned around and in each indexes we've been able to improve largely in each. Page 31; this is the EBITDA margin by each segment. And they are all improving steadily. Page 32, shows the credit rating. Cash flow in page 34, after the acquisition we've been having aggressive CapEx. There was the big announcement we made right after the acquisition. And we've been able to finish all those runaround of the CapEx and hit the peak. So now that we are expecting to turn around in from \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in terms of cash as well. So for the fiscal year 2008, we were able to improve by 345 billion yen. For the fiscal year 2009, we're expecting 250 billion yen of free cash flow. CapEx, right after the acquisition, we brought forward the CapEx plan, which was planned in Vodafone K.K.'s period, which was expecting two years to spend, but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we're bringing it forward to one year, so that we will be able to provide the better communication environment for the customers. And that is why \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that we had a big CapEx, but now that we're expecting 220 for next fiscal year. In the fiscal 2008, in the original forecast we had was 280 billion yen or some, but we were able to finish around 260. So it's closing in a silly way. For fiscal year 2009, each company other than us is announcing that revenue down, profit down, which is not only in Japan but in worldwide. But in our case, in our company, we're expecting the revenue and profit increase. I mentioned earlier that even we sell handset a lot, but it doesn't mean that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will give us better revenue. Actually it doesn't give us any revenue at all even that we sell the handsets rather we sell more, we have more negative impact. But at the same time, we need to offset that from the telecom service revenue. And \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 revenue down and profit increase is- sounds like a excuse. So we need to compensate those, and for fiscal year 2009, that we'd like to see the revenue and profit increase. Without any excuse or explanation, but we would like to have a simple result with revenue and profit increase, which is the forecast for the fiscal year 2009. In page 37, which I mentioned earlier, again, the earnings result \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, earnings forecast for fiscal 2009. In page 38, we are expecting a profit increase by 17%. This 359 billion yen of the operating income, which is the actual from the fiscal 2008. In how are we positioning compared to the other market or other companies, it's shown in the page 39, there are some actuals already disclosed in those star marks on the right. There are forecast ranking coming from Bloomberg. So with that star marks are the one that the actuals already disclosed by each company. And for the overall fiscal year 2008, we are currently ranked in the 11th. For fiscal year 2009, if the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our forecast of 420 billion yen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 suppose the other companies are about the same operating income as fiscal year 2008, then that we will be able to be in, within the 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 top 10 in the next fiscal year. But whether we would expect that some of that company show the revenue down rather than revenue increase. In that case that we may be able to rank in top further EBITDA position. In operating income variance in page 41, we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 here was the competitors these are the operating income variance with NTT DOCOMO and KDDI. For KDDI, expecting 6% increase in operating income, and NTT DOCOMO, 0.1%, a negative variance for the operating income in fiscal year 2009. These are the figures, forecasted figures for 2009, which was just disclosed the other day. And compared to that, that we're expecting the revenue increase is 17%. Is this because our market share is more, that's why that we have EBITDA variance of operating income, but we'd like you show the absolute figures for the operating income in the next slide. The absolute figure compared to three competitors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 amongst there are three operators, we have the best growth in operating income trend. And actually, we are coming very close to KDDI in terms of absolutes figures of operating income. NTT DOCOMO is showing the revenue decrease. That forecast has already been disclosed. So, I believe that there are trend [inaudible] is showing quite good. So after few years later, how will we be? That's another question, but not only increase in the net additions, but having red figures in the profit, revenue, or/our rough management doesn't make sense, making too much stretch to show that the best figures in net addition for 20 consecutive months or something that kind of rumor is going around, but in reality we have been making a steady revenue increase, profit increase and at the same time keeping the position of number one in net additions. In free cash flow on page 43; expecting the 38% increase. Ranking for free cash flow is shown on page 44, currently ranked eighth and 250 billion yen, which is the forecast for 2009. We will be able to be in a better position in the ranking. As mentioned earlier the star marks on your right is the forecasted figure and probably this can be replaced with the actual number some time next month, once those are disclosed. And for the fiscal year 2009 we are expecting to be better positioned in this ranking, probably fifth or sixth. That was actually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I commented in October last year, so close to that pace we are moving forward. For fiscal year 2009 we expect we will be around fifth or sixth. That was a comment I made in October last year. And my comment usually often hit the reality. But it's not a commitment at all because we don't know what will happen to other companies. But our forecast announced is that we will aim to achieve. And next is the cash flow. As I just mentioned, about two trillion yen acquisition in cash was made. That's why we have about, over two trillion yen interest-bearing debt. At the moment it's about 1.9 trillion yen. For the three years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the coming three years we expect we'll be able to have free cash flow of one trillion yen. Therefore, our net interest-bearing debt will be halved in two years from what we have currently. And then also from that point in three years; that means in five years from today we will have zero net interest-bearing debt. SOFTBANK is going to be viewed as a rough in management and lots of burden of debt. That might be shared by many people as residual image. But in two years that image is going to be changed greatly. And also in five \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in three years from that time on, SOFTBANK will have an image free of debt I expect. And coming down to that end is the free net interest-bearing debt. We already have sowed a seed in Japan and China and we made number one in mobile Internet field. And we have already placed necessary steps-downs. Therefore we do not need to make any major investment because we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there are already seeds we've sowed; that is the basic policy. So we have no plan to make a big investment. Therefore we will \\xe2\\x80\\x93 coming down to the fate of zero net interest-bearing debt. And we are very much confident. And as the top management we are also very confident in that. And that's where we are. And for the three years, one trillion yen of free cash flow is to be generated. And this page 51 shows the graph charts of the image. So 250 billion yen of free cash flow for this fiscal year is not like inflated. We have good, solid endorsement behind that, so generate this much free cash flow for this year, next year and after the next. Fiscal year information, we made announcement the other day about the IDC. That is our data inter company. And that was sold to Yahoo! Japan. And that is not included in the free cash flow because it's an intra-group company transaction. Some people just fear that SOFTBANK has made the sale to Yahoo! Japan on purpose to adjust its numbers. But that's not true. That transaction is not included with the free cash flow because it was a transaction between group companies. And without that we expect to achieve 250 billion yen of free cash flow for this year and also more for the next year and on. And as a result as I just repeatedly mentioned the 1.9 trillion yen of net interest-bearing debt at the moment is going to be halved in two years and in fiscal year 2014 that will become zero. And this is announced. That means for the last six months SOFTBANK did not announce any forecast of business performance. And many people actually had imagined that SOFTBANK would have negative numbers. But we have achieved all those numbers we announced and even those we have revised upward. So we do not make any cosmetic announcement at all. This is our target. And we do not announce it with light-hearted, we do not mention those numbers lightly. We will make efforts to achieve those numbers. So as I just explained SOFTBANK is now at the stage of harvesting from the investment period. And many investors so far ask the questions about our dividend. And so far we always answered with a flat divided payment. But as we are at the stage of harvest, therefore for fiscal year 2009, this year, we are going to double the dividend payment from 2.5 yen to five yen per share. And the year after the next, we expect we will have big free cash flow cumulated and we will have net interest-bearing debt to be heard. So we are planning to have bigger dividend. And those are in fiscal year 2014 we are planning to increase dividend further. So in fiscal year 2009 and in fiscal year 2011 and in fiscal year 2014 we will increase dividend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these are three phase \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in a three phase manner. So SOFTBANK is now mature enough to talk about the cash flow management. In 1995 when I said that SOFTBANK would become an Internet company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that was an Internet company declaration I made. And for the coming years, at that time, free cash flow or profit or revenues, those were not in the scope of target. But equity was the target. So the companies with high potential are the ones we were targeting at that time. And now we have about 700 companies where we have equity, directly or through funds, and those are expected to win for sure and we declared ourselves as an Internet company and we didn't care much about the profit, cash flow or sales, but that was a chance in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 once in century, so we targeted equity uptown. So for that period, SOFTBANK was viewed as an investment company, not an operating company, because it did not have a cash flow. So it was viewed as an investment company not operating company. And when we started the Broadband business, now they have actually changed their views. It's not just an investing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 investment company but it does operation. And now we have a good operating cash flow and we have proven ourselves that we are very serious about operations. So I believe that many people are convinced that SOFTBANK is not a mere investment company. At the Tokyo Stock Exchange market, we are defined as a wholesale company. When we listed for the over-the-counter stock exchange, SOFTBANK Group was defined as a wholesale company, but I actually challenged it, at the time actually most of our sales came from the distribution of software, so that's why that definition was made, but that was not a real, that was not reality of the company, because we didn't aim for wholesale company, we were focusing on the information technology. And I made an enthusiastic discussion about it, but that was not actually admitted. So still our company is registered as a wholesale company, which seems strange to me. But as I just mentioned, things always keep its residual image, so the wholesale company definition is rather residual image about SOFTBANK. And SOFTBANK has various residual images I understand. But in five years or in 10 years, those images are going to be changed, I believe. The biggest operations we run is the mobile business via Mobile Communications. And many people still now understand the mobile operator as a telephone company. When we decided to acquire Vodafone Japan operation, there were some questions asked why are we going to buy a telephone company, but it was not our intention, because we were aiming to become Internet Company, so the Mobile Communication was just part of the Information Technology business. So it's not just a mobile-telephone, but mobile-Internet. Internet, I believe today still has residual image of being used through personal computer. But mobile-Internet here was that I talked about at the beginning of last year, and I found that was the one we released last year. So mobile phones \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mobile Communications is changing from telephone service to Internet service. And then just for IT revolution is something we have been aiming for. So our Mobile Internet will be part of our future vision. And ergo for the current management has not being suffered from Mobile Communications business and we also keep our high ambitions. And most of the experts thought that we will be the one that losing their market, but two years later, our net addition, we took about 54% in fiscal year 2008. In page 62, in the past one year, our customer base \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how much growth were there KDDI, 1.7% and NTT DOCOMO, 2.3%, in our case, 11% growth. And one of the reasons why we had a big growth there is from the market SOFTBANK, it has been using SOFTBANK brand and broadcasting the TV advertisement. And this was the first since founding the company using this mobile. So the nationwide TV advertisement, this was our first experience of using a SOFTBANK MOBILE to advertise SOFTBANK. And even in our first case, we were able to gain the first position of preference from both male and female in all of the segments for the fiscal year 2008. I think this was the first ever to be able to achieve such position. In system categories, we were able to gain number one in 13 categories. Music and sound, amongst the old industries including automobiles, drinks like Coca Cola. So this also includes all industry, not only mobile phones, or not only communication companies, but home appliances, automobiles, all the advertisement including in here in amongst that. Music and sound were number two, [inaudible] was number seven but, other than those two categories, we were able to gain number one position. So with those we were able to expand the customer base. Next is the improved data ARPU. Increasing ARPU, so the increased revenue per user base, which is very important for us and we've been focusing to improve this area. And for the mid to long-term, where do we need to gain the revenue, if that data ARPU is one. And in this area, amongst the three carriers, we are the one that are showing the best increased ratio in the data ARPU. And we would like to keep an eye on this area. ARPU itself, as we did the substantial ARPU, we still add all those bars in this chart. Lets see, the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my understanding for the substantial calculations for the user spending per month. But accounting-wise, this year will part in the bottom \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the purple part in the second from the bottom or/and maybe the blue in the third. Those three are the accounting definitions for the ARPU. On top of that, we have a monthly repayment along with the monthly discounts. This green part has been excluded from ARPU but, in fiscal year 2009, that we've been already starting for first quarter. And we expect that we'll be able to turnaround and hit the bottom, so in accounting definitions, after all, so that we're expecting to bottom out and increase. Those customers who already expired the maturity of the monthly discount is going to show, so that will be the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 another factor for us to bottom out this ARPU. And the least factor is from the expiry of the monthly discounts, at the same time the improvement of data ARPU. So for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to contribute to data ARPU improvement that will be working on the content for the data services. In addition, the other day we have seen DOCOMO announced the data flat plan, new plan has been announced. 1,029 yen has been decreased to its 490 yen and because we had measures to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 policy to counter-measure \\xe2\\x80\\x93 show the counter-measures against the competitors it's material. If it's a minor changes from the competitors, we are not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we do not care about it, but if it's material for the customer service, we have already announced that we would like to counterattack within 24 hours. And we never announced that we stop that policy, so this time as INTT announced this discount in our packet flat that we'd like to also provide a similar type of the pricing plan. In the page 71, S-1 Battle, today after the announcing the champion of the April Battle. And we've been seeing a lot of interest in content being gathered together in our services. In the mobile internet content, we've been offering 5,000 worth of content with \\xc2\\xa5315 to the customer; called Content [inaudible] pack and this also being well received by the customers. So far the customer had to register one-by-one to enjoy the content. In that time that the customer had to pay sometimes, \\xc2\\xa55,000 or so, so that's why that we investigated the popular content for the customers and we aggregate those and provide with \\xc2\\xa5315. And, in addition, customers only have to register once, doesn't have to register one-by-one, which is also well received by the customers so far. So we've been seeing a big increase on a daily basis. And, as for widget, our weekly weather forecast is shown on the screen without having several tab or the click on the handset, not only the weather forecast but the news, share price, various types of content are available. This is also being well received. So, compared to the other competitors, we've been showing good improvement here. Another good example can be the maps. So, from the standby display, only one click that links you to the map, [inaudible] maps. So we've been preparing for the other enjoyable content as well. And the third point in page 77 is we manage efficiently. Now short-term turn gives us the worst impact to our management. There are lots of customers who turn in 3.6 month or so. So, but that this has been decreasing which is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has give us a better drive to the management. Another thing is that because we introduced the handset sales, handset installment program, which was the first in the world, and the customer can bring, without paying anything, but start paying monthly basis. But at the same time, can enjoy the monthly discount. In the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after we introduced this, because customer can bring home without paying anything, we sometimes had the customers run away with the handset without paying anything after all, which gives us a bad impact to the management, and we had \\xc2\\xa530 billion, 50 million balance was out for accounts. For those customers who doesn't have any intension to pay, have to remove, so we had the countermeasure authority to eliminate those customers, who don't have any intension to pay the handset price. So that we have been able to reduce the allowance for doubtful accounts and we expect a further decrease in fiscal year 2009. So here, this is also another contributor for our revenue increase, or the profit increase for the fiscal year '09. Competitors just few months ago that they start full-fledged handset installment program I believe that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I assume that the same type of issue facing and we probably are the first one to face this issue compared to the other two. And the network satisfaction improvements ratio has been improved largely, because we had advanced CapEx, to have a better network environment. That led us to the better satisfaction level from the customer. And the next is the cost reduction. One year ago that we had a big regret at the large inventory. So, using past year, we have been decreasing the inventory by 30%. As a result that we were able to come down to \\xc2\\xa532.3 billion for the inventory. And the annual handset sales, because we have been keeping the number one net additions, so lots of new customers coming into our network. But, at the same time, the customers are upgrading the handsets. So those cases \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this annual handset sales includes both new handsets and upgrade handsets. In our KDDI case, 10 million, DoCoMo case 20 million, in other hand, SOFTBANK is 8.4. So, that's why that they have bigger inventory in their hands. But if you see the ratio, the inventory ratio, okay, it's 32 billion, but the KDDI or DoCoMo is 77 or 123. So, the balance of the handset inventory \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because we have learned the lesson a year ago so that's why that we've been working on reducing this largely. And having a conservative view on the valuation loss to see the content of inventory clearly, so reduce the number of inventory as well as the inside of it. So, using the past one year, it wasn't rough management to have a larger inventory for customer acquisition or not having a lot of allowance for the doubtful accounts. But rather we had a micromanagement and rather a conservative view on the screening of customers' credibility, so that we were able to come to this stage. At the same time keep the position of net addition in number one. So, it's not the rough management, but actually we've being paying closer attention to this area as well for the further management. So, when you see the SOFTBANK Group, Yahoo! is making money and SOFTBANK has a China market, but there are sometimes tales that the mobile business itself is not making money, but actually SOFTBANK MOBILE is making us steady growth and have been improving the quality of the business itself and gaining the net addition. So, that's how I can present the content of the business. But another thing is in scene. SOFTBANK acquired TELECOM, which is often called that the failure of the acquisition and before then, that had a broadband business, had a big negative figure for that month's CapEx and also told that this was another failure which is another residual image from \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the market. But actually operating income for broadband infrastructure, as you can see in page 84, the above line is broadband and the bottom one is the fixed-line telecommunication. We acquired JAPAN TELECOM, now called SOFTBANK TELECOM. These still have a diverse CapEx but both of them now showing the income steadily. So adding those two shows, in the next slide, as a definition of fixed-line business of SOFTBANK Group, here, compared to the competitors' broadband and fixed-line telecommunications, those two businesses together, here as called the Fixed-Line business segment. And compared to that the competitors are here on NTT East and NTT West. So the voice communication business plus optical fibers or the ADSL broadband business, those two are run by NTT East and West and KDDI. And also KDDI subprime excluding EU business. So if you compare on that basis, then the NTT East and the West for the last six years, the operating income is gone down and KDDI has about \\xc2\\xa550 billion in red. And against that SOFTBANK business, actually for the last six years, is growing steadily. And now it's close to \\xc2\\xa570 billion of operating income. So please pay attention to the steepness of the lines. SOFTBANK has less number of lines compared with NTT East and West by far, that means they have a scale merit and that also can work negatively. And some people may think that our scale is smaller, that's why we are making black ink. But KDDI, they are not very big compared, but still they are in red. And our residual image just drag (1.02.04) numbers in red, but actually we have turned around our business. So \\xc2\\xa5100 billion in some years is in sight, so that's where we're moving forward. We are very much paying attention to the actual management and maybe people think that we are unscrupulous in terms of management, but in reality, we are very patient and we are very sensible in management and we have made a good improvement. And now future: The step-stones we made for our future growth and one of them is the Internet speed in China and that has grown very much. I'd like to encourage you to look at the situation from broader perspective. When we made an entry to the Internet or broadband or to a mobile business, we always had a picture in 10 years or 20 years. And we made many simulations and we checked with data and we asked ourselves that question. And we decide the management policy that is our custom. Now looking back at the Internet history which started in the United States, it was in 1995 we can say. But around 1998, the number of the users among American citizens accounted for 50% in all users in the world. And Asia just accounted for 19%. But six years from now- year 2015. In the total Internet users, Asia will account for 50% and United States will have 12%. So for in the world of Internet to become number one, a company which has a number one position in the United States, can become number one, but in whatever category like Yahoo!, Google, but... So, so far, now, companies with number one in the United States achieved the number one in the Internet's world, but in six years from now, maybe that's not true because just a 12% will represent the users in the United States. In Asia, we'll have 50%, especially number one position in China. We'll be as significant as what used to be five years ago, 10 years ago in the United States. So five years from now, if you are not number one in China then you cannot be number one in the world in the Internet world. That is my speculation that Asia and especially China, has been forecast for the last several years, and SOFTBANK will acquire the number one position in Japan in terms of the Internet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as Internet company. But also in China we have made \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have created a good footprint in China as well. In China, we'll have 50% in the future in amongst Internet users and the United States will have 12%. So overall, being number one in Asia, is a very important next vision to ourselves and mobile Internet. We'll acquire majority of the shares in the Internet in the future. So Asia number one is very important \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will be very important and there also the mobile Internet company number one DoCoMo very important. So we are aiming for the number one in Asia. And Taobao has about 80% market share. And in auction in China that was comment I made before. But actually not just in auction, but in all e-Commerce fields Taobao has almost 80% share. So that is overwhelming number one. Now it has over 100 million users. And how about the absolute numbers? At the moment, the world economy is tumbling head down and just to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is called a once in a Century crisis. And yesterday we actually had some company representatives visited China, and in Shanghai \\xe2\\x80\\x93 year-on-year, in the field of retail it will be deteriorating market around the world. Shanghai actually achieved the 13% growth year-on-year even the China overall has a 6%. That was what our representatives heard when they visited China the other day. So from January to March they had 13% in retail business. And TV shopping they had a bigger number in the growth. And so China is seeing a rapid growth. And online shopping using the Internet also it's showing a rapid growth. And how big is the online shopping will become? Three or \\xc2\\xa510 trillion is coming in several years. That was the market forecast. And the actual numbers in fiscal year 2007-2008. And for the fiscal year 2008, it was \\xc2\\xa51.8 trillion; that is the online shop market in China. And the Taobao has about \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion. Taobao is not a listed company yet. And the total online shopping market in China was 1.8 trillion and of which \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion was Taobao's. And online market in China is going to grow to 5 or 8 or \\xc2\\xa511 trillion that is actually a survey result from a external agency. And Taobao has a great footprint already. And lastly, the fiscal year 2009, not decline in revenue and increase in profit, but we'll have revenue and profit growth in fiscal year 2009. And for the coming three years, we will generate about \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of free cash flow and as a result in three years we will have net interest bearing debt. And in three years after that we project zero net interest bearing debt. So it's not like debt management, but free cash flow management. That is our image forecast. And now we are at that matured stage. And we do contribute to people's lifestyle suitable to the 21century. Although, here is a correction. It was not a wholesale company, I just had the residual image myself. I just mentioned that, our definition at the TCE is a wholesale company but it's not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 It's information technology company now it's already revised. That's all from me about the earning results. And I would like to take questions from you.\",\n",
       " '2009 Q1': \"Hi. I'm Son from SoftBank. Thank you very much for joining with us during your busy schedule. Since the establishment of the business, there are several big milestones at the time that when we started the Internet, when we started the Broadband, when we started the Mobile business. So every time we had a milestone, we once made a decrease of revenue, our profit and also sometimes have some troubles to customers. But after several years, start seeing profit up from each segment. And this time, the earnings results for the first quarter because we've been overcoming such milestones and now we believe that we are now making a firm step one after another to those experiences that we had in the past. And once again I believe that you can recognize the firm structure of the business that we've been operating and the results shows that too. The business itself I believe, the content of the business clearly showing that we are in the stage with the firm steps led by our own. Now I'd like to go into the presentation. We have three highlights. One is the achieving the revenue and profit increase. This time exceeded \\xc2\\xa5100 billion of operating income for the first time on quarterly basis. Year-on-year base, net sales and operating income also increased, especially Mobile Communications because it has been experiencing the decrease of revenue and profit from the Mobile Communications. But that was only because of the tentative situation from the installment sales of the handset. And I have been repeating that several times, but this time, we don't need to repeat that and now that we had experienced some expiring of the 24 month of the installment program, and now that they have to see as in the normal stage. So from now on, it's more easier to understand or more precisely understand our business content. So this time, revenue and profit increase has been driven by Mobile Communications itself, increased 9% in net sales and 36% in operating income. In total, operating income increase was 27%, but you can see a higher increase in Mobile Communications only. And the third highlight is the improvement, \\xc2\\xa5250 billion free cash flow has been committed, and only for the first quarter we already increased by \\xc2\\xa594.4 billion year-on-year. Now let's get into details. You can see in the page three, net sales down to free cash flow, all of the lines are making achievements of increase largely. Page four shows the breakdown in the backlog. And page five shows especially highlighting the Mobile Communications net sales and operating income of Mobile Communications actually showing higher improvement. This clearly tells you that the Mobile Communication drove the revenue and profit increase. Just before our announcement, at the same time at 3 O' clock, NTT DoCoMo also made an announcement earnings results for the first quarter. KDDI have already announced the other day. And you can see the comparison of the first quarter amongst the three operators. And thanks for you all that we were the only one to be able to show the revenue and profit increase for the first quarter. Page seven, I had mentioned a little bit earlier that for this fiscal year, we expecting \\xc2\\xa5420 billion and \\xc2\\xa5250 billion for operating income and free cash flow respectively. This has been already announced last year. Because normally I don't believe that are forecasting these figures in 18 months before, but during the economy crush that we've already been announcing the forecast for these two. And there were some questions, and there are some people or probably more people didn't believe that we will be achieve this number or this forecast for fiscal year '09. And you can see that the first quarter is actual \\xc2\\xa5108.2 billion of operating income, and our expectations or our hope or the commitment was to increase the operating income to \\xc2\\xa560.8 billion compared to the previous fiscal year, and have already increased \\xc2\\xa523.2 billion. So we are on right track for achieving this operating income forecast. And the free cash flow is \\xc2\\xa5250 billion as in forecast, and this is \\xc2\\xa568.4 billion increase compared to the previous fiscal year. But only with this first quarter, we have already been achieving to increase \\xc2\\xa594.4 billion so from the second to fourth quarter, suppose it will be flat result for the free cash flow, but already, we will be able to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we may be able to achieve this forecast for free cash flow in fiscal year '09. Operating income, at this moment, we don't have any plan to have any upward revision for operating income and free cash flow, but you can see that we're making right track on the operating income and free cash flow towards our forecast. Page nine shows the consolidated net sales and breakdown. Page 10 shows the net sales. As mentioned that Mobile Communications segment is the biggest driver; so this is a result for that. And in the previous earnings results announcement, we were able to achieve the increase in telecom service revenue in the first time. But the handset sales was still below in the previous announcement, but this time, actually both in handset sales and telecom service revenue were able to make a higher record. Page 11 shows consolidated EBITDA in each segment, all of them showing the increase year-on-year. Next is the operating income. This again, in every segment showing the increase year-on-year. As I mentioned in the beginning, first we start the Internet business. Most of the investment was red, but still I thought \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said that it's once in 100 years opportunity; so I didn't really mind about having red figures for few years, but we should drive towards the Internet. That's why that we have experienced, and as planned that we did record some red figures in our book. But those actually turning into the black figures including Yahoo Japan Corporation. At the time we entered the broadband period, we recorded about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion red figure, but thanks for that, again we were able to turn that into black. Telecom as well, we switched to the direct sales services of the Telecom and we spent some CapEx so that we did record some red figures, but again that we were able to turn that around. Mobile was black figures from the beginning, but this also making a smooth progress. So sometimes, it was quite high risk, but one each that showing quite profitable, turning into profitable business and earning a cash flow well. Ordinary income, this too we were able to increase by 45% year-on-year. Net income too increased by 41% year-on-year. Then this was the report high for first quarter. And this is a breakdown of the net income in page 15, and page 16 shows the key financial indexes. In every key financial index, we were able to achieve the improvement year-on-year basis. And the interest-bearing debt reduction status, page 18 shows the breakdown of the interest, consolidated interest-bearing debt. We have 2 trillion some yen of the interest-bearing debt, but we have 537 cash position plus which includes the both unused portion of credit line facility and cash position. And what we planning to repay of the corporate bond is shown in your right hand side of page 20. So 10 billions of repayment of corporate bond redemption date is coming, and we have about 500 or so billion yen of the cash position. So we have abundant repayment resources available in our hand. So taking the cash position out from the interest-bearing debt which is the net interest-bearing debt, right after the merger of Vodafone K.K., that was the highest net interest-bearing debt which was \\xc2\\xa52.3 trillion -- \\xc2\\xa52.4 trillion. And currently, after three years, we were able to reduce about \\xc2\\xa5480 billion, and because of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 running the installment program for the handset sales, if we take that portion, actually, we have already reduced by \\xc2\\xa5713 billion of the interest-bearing debt in two years. And because we were able to improve our credit status, we issued a corporate bond first in two years for both individual investors and the institutional investors, and actually, it was sold straight away, and that was also a happy news for us. Issuing corporate bonds sometimes is viewed as an opposite move to reducing the debt, but that is just a misunderstanding. As repayment scale is bigger, that's why the net interest-bearing debt is declining steadily. The issue of corporate bonds and the repayment of debt in total will help the net interest-bearing debt decrease as planned. The payment source which is that cash flow and I'd have to tell you about the cash flow result. Operating cash flow for the first \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this chart shows the comparison of first quarter of three years and you can see the steady growth of operating cash flow, that's because we have a good growth of the, we have the free cash flow growth, that's because we have a good growth of operating cash flow. And next is CapEx. Right after the acquisition of Vodafone K.K., we had a peak, but now you can see, we have clearly passed the peak. And also, the free cash flow here is showing a great improvement. And as I just mentioned, \\xc2\\xa5420 billion of operating income on an annual basis is committed, and of the free cash flow annual result is also committed; that is \\xc2\\xa5250 billion and we are very confident to achieve those. And the future cash flow, now I would like to draw your attention to it. I just mentioned the current status, but the future free cash flow, now we are very confident to achieve the \\xc2\\xa5250 billion this year, and this is not just temporarily happening. In the case of our operation is being improved, therefore for the coming two years, we will be able to grow this free cash flow. That means in three years in total, we will be able to achieve this \\xc2\\xa51 trillion or around free cash flow, and we are very much confident about that. And this \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of free cash flow is going to be generated, and then what will happen, the current net interest-bearing debt of \\xc2\\xa51.29 trillion is going to be halved. And in three years after 2011, meaning 2014, we will be able to reduce the net interest-bearing debt to zero, and we once again are very confident. That means in substance, no debt operation. And there are three sources for the growth of cash flow, the first one is Mobile Communications business and the second is Fixed Line business and the third is Yahoo Japan. The first one which generates the most of the free cash flow increment is the Mobile Communications business. The business model of this business is very simple. When the customer base expands, then we will have cash income per subscriber from that customer base, and you just sign those two items. Then that will bring you the cash flow increase. So this is very simple. So, if we are asked to demonstrate our business model in a very simple manner, then this is the chart. This is just a simple equation. Single equation can display the business model. So when we have a very stable customer base, then I excuse the interpreter, we have the cash income per subscriber, very stable plan, the expansion as the customer base just gives us increment. And the factor is the customer base expansion. For the first quarter this year compared to au and DoCoMo, we have achieved the number one in net addition. And we have been achieving number one position in the net addition for last two years. And here you can see the red part of the Vodafone Japan's field, and gray portions show what happened after we acquired Vodafone K.K. But the company is actually the same one, but still it was reborn after the acquisition by SoftBank. So Vodafone K.K. was reborn after the acquisition by SoftBank, and that is very obvious if you look at the growth of the customer base. You have the steady growth of the customer base in one word, and the cash income per subscriber, how much really it is, against the customer base. Here you can see the bar chart encoding the voice, data and basic charge and handset and phone payment. And you can actually look at it from different angles. The most important thing is how much cash income per subscriber is coming to us. Per subscriber, how much cash is coming to us? And if you look at the last two years and several months, then you can see it's very stable. So once again, the cash income per subscriber is stable and the customer base is expanding. Then it's just in nutshell, to have this chart on the page 39. So we have the subscriber growth and we have a stable cash income per subscriber, then if you time those two items, then you can get the increment. So this is very simple equation. So, there might be many implications according to the accounting or maybe the impact by the installment receivables. Accounting is of course one of the evaluations method, but if you look at the cash, then it's very simple to look at it. Well maybe someone will see that SoftBank had a rather drop in revenue, but had the increase in the profit, that we have been very stable to grow our customer base and the cash income per subscriber was stable. Therefore we have achieved this improvement in cash flow, and here, why we have been successful to expand the customer base. The, one of the factors is branding. In this first quarter, the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the April, and in May and in June, we have been number one once again in TV commercial preference by company, by production and by brand. Usually, there are 400 new commercials coming, but we have been number one by company, by production, by brand. And sometimes we dropped to the second place by company field, but we have been in the number one place in many areas. And in the TV commercial, the TV talents play a very important role. In the male field of the TV commercial talent preference the first one is Mr. Dante Carver, our character. And for the female division we have Ms. Aya Ueto and Ms. Kanako Higuchi. Those are actresses. And they are our commercial characters. And for the male division, SMAP members are having the very good positions up to the fifth. And SMAP members now have joined to our brand characters. So in total, if you look at the preference ranking together with the female and the male and character fields, then actually the first rank was taken by our white family father, the white dog. And from the first to eighth, all those characters ranked in are our characters. And from the Thursday this week you will see the new TV commercial of SMAP. And usually the TV commercial film is 15 seconds. But we have produced a 60 second TV commercial. So two days from today one minute to 19 hours there will a one minute TV commercial on almost... Thank you very much. And I believe we have the largest set for TV commercial shooting in the world, I believe. And the stage was actually 70 meter long. And that just stayed there for one day. So you can see how big the scale was. And we made lots of effort to it. And all the members of the SMAP were together, which is rare occasion for them. And we have a very stylish TV commercial now. The other important event for us is the iPhone 3G. And there has been one year since the release. And there have been critics that iPhone is not suitable for Japanese users or other comments and there are many critics. Mobile phone experts they had pros and the cons. But here you can see the results. In the second quarter last year, that means July, iPhone 3G was released. And the top to seven models at that time including the common SoftBank. And what was the trend after that in terms of the sales of the handset through the last one year? And here you can see the gray bar, that is the SoftBank. And orange is by KDDI. And red is by DoCoMo. And ours, the ones which was in the top seven, have lost momentum after one year. It's just like a little tree branches. So it's just going down. And how about iPhone? It actually has been in the first position or sometimes in the second position for the last one year. And iPhone 3GS was released last month. And actually the inventory is very scarce. Once in two days or three days new shipment comes, then it's just sold out. So iPhone 3GS around the world is seeing very scarce inventory. And all the countries are fighting for that. And we actually wish if we had more inventory, then we would have been able to have more net additions. And that situation has been continuing for the last one or two months. That means iPhone is unique. It's not just like the other vanilla models, which changing its position after the one or two month after the release. So iPhone is different, because almost all the models in Japan after its release will drop its momentum just like the little tree branches. And after one year it's always ranked out of 100 ranks. Against that, iPhone actually, together with the time passing it increases its attraction, because it's having a bigger line-up of applications. And also, over the time, the OS is improving and evoluting. That's why that is the feature of iPhone. So it's not really the mobile but rather the portable mobile PC we can say. And myself using every day basis. And I would like to ask you here in audience, anybody who is already using iPhone 3GS, can you raise your hand if you're already using it? I think you should change your lifestyle with that. I've been using iPhone for about one year. And using this every day, one day after another day, I've been surprising with this function. But after using 3GS actually the impressive feeling has already changed, totally surpassed the feeling. In which that you feel the things that you never be able to feel with your former mobile or PC. And I could say that how could I be living without it? So this is something very much innovational or changing the lifestyle. So start using iPhone 3GS everyday and really less one-tenth of the time that they're spending on PC. So I am the one almost using PC or Internet every day. And actually the time that I spending on that has been lessened one-tenth. But on the other hand, using iPhone has become ten times as much. So the biggest impact onto the lifestyle of yours. When I made a first touch on a PC or computer that was an impressive moment, the feeling, or the first time I touched on Internet. This is something equivalent to that moment that I first touched on iPhone 3GS. So that's how great it is. And two years later I believe that you will be able to tell why I said this here. And you will agree with me. But here what I want to emphasize is that, iPhone is everything? It's not that. There are several many great mobiles. And other mobiles or other models will be something similar to iPhone. So it's not only the voice communicator of the mobile age, but it will become something very close or similar to iPhone. So all the vendors worldwide they will change to smartphone like iPhone. Android, the same Android will be smartphone like iPhone. And other ones like handset models, everything, I believe they will be coming closer to iPhone or smartphone. Which means that they will becoming a mobile Internet machine. So the people who imagine well how the mobile will be in future, but I would like to introduce them to use the iPhone because they will already be able to experience the mobile future. At the time when first \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the period of gun comes in Japan, and on the other hand people using a sword. So they were very sorry to know that their enemy is using sword, on the other hand that ours are using guns. So you'll never be able to tell until you actually experience with it. So that's the same thing can apply. That I believe, that those who are already using iPhone 3G already experiencing the mobile future, but once you touch on the 3GS then you will know that one step further on the mobile future. So I sincerely like to ask you to start using the iPhone. In today's earnings results announcement, then we should have sell stock today. So I would like to stop myself. But coming back to the presentation, I believe many of the corporate users who start using the iPhone were able to reduce the overtime. Or I would say the three hours a day or so, or something \\xc2\\xa530,000 equivalent overtime, was able to reduced. That kind of story that I often hear. So if you can reduce \\xc2\\xa530,000 per month, then that should be some encouragement for the company to start using the iPhone in the corporate. In our case SoftBank, the management layers and employees of 4,000 people are already using, not only the normal office environment, but in various occasions that it's being used. That's what I wanted to say. iPhone 3GS has been released and there are ceremony in the day. So that was the Eve Fest of 3GS. So I'm not saying that iPhone is everything. Other mobile is coming closer to iPhone. So this is the good one example of mobile Internet, as an advanced case of the mobile Internet. That's why that I recommending. And after I became to 3GS, the faster \\xe2\\x80\\x93 doubled the speed, then also memory improved. Those who don't use iPhone in your normal mobile, and if you are using upper level, but inside of it the flash memory size, do you know it's about 100 megabyte to 200 megabyte. 100 to 200. On the other hand, 32 gigabytes which means 320 times as much of the normal handset. So you can see how small a handset that you've been playing with. That's how we can say. Even though the camera advanced, other functions advanced, but if the memory size is small then you will not be able to do much. Of course if you have a microSD card to add some capacity. But there are some strengths that you have in the standard function. That's why you can enjoy pictures, videos, games and everything with it. And other improvements were made as well. It's now that mobile Internet era. And I also mentioned that the mobile Internet year and that was the first year of the mobile Internet after all. And the second is the fixed line business. Fixed line business meaning SoftBank BB and Telecom. Some of those are called as fixed line business. And this first quarter operating income was the record high and is making smooth progress. Compared to the competitors, NTT East and West, sum of those two is \\xc2\\xa544.5 billion, and decreasing every quarter. KDDI is making about \\xc2\\xa556 billion loss every year this year. But on the other hand we are making increase in the operating income. Other company also providing fixed line telecommunications and also broadband. So this is the same measure that we are using to compare here. So fixed line business also we're making a good operating income and free cash flow. So it is becoming more and more healthier business. And third point is Yahoo Japan. Under such difficult situation in economy, but still that Yahoo Japan sustains trend of revenue and profit increase. Free cash flow also showing a good trend. So those are the major business that we are running in Japan, and those are the main source of the free cash flow. And we said that we're not going to make a big merger or buy-outs or we are going be the debt-zero operation. Then people may say that we are not making any progress. But that's not true. We will be competing in two area. First is that we would like to be the number one Internet company. And that's not something possible with only one operator. So that's why that we set up the joint venture with the Verizon, Vodafone and China Mobile so that we'd be able to increase that area. But that's something does not require CapEx or anything. But at the same time we will able to see a good fruit out of it. And another thing is we would like to become the number one in Asia, which is becoming more and more realizable. Mobile Internet number one is only the vision stage. And we are working on that with the technology development. But Internet company in Asia to become number one is more specific. And we're making several steps already. Yahoo Japan in Japan is now taking a dominant, overwhelming number one position. In addition to that, to become the number one in Asia, we made a big step in China. And I think that's growing well. The reason why that I stick onto China, that I would like to show you with some slides. China market is developing continuously and I would like to talk about our advancement in China. The first one is about the entire Chinese market. Next year China's GDP will exceed Japan to be the world number one. That is quite likely. And actually I have been talking about that two or three years ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse the interpreter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ten years ago that China is going to be one of the biggest GDP countries. And it's not just the GDP but the Internet population, mobile usage and foreign currency reserves and new cars shipped. And I would like to look at one by one. And please have a look at this chart. And if you look at the bars, then next year China is going to exceed Japan in terms of GDP. And Japan will be ranked down to the third and China will be ranked up to the second. That is most likely to happen. And the second is the Internet population. And actually China has already exceeded U.S. Internet population last year, which was 220 million. And now last year China's Internet population reached 250 million and was number one already. And if you look at the penetration ratio, then in the U.S. it is 73% but China it's just 19%. So that means it has the room to grow further. It's developing, but still it's already number one in the world. So if you look at the opportunity of the Internet business, then you really cannot ignore China. And as for the mobile phone, yes, China has the biggest customer base in the world, double than the U.S. and six times bigger than Japan. And for the foreign currency reserves once again China is number one, exceeding Japan. And for the numbers of cars shipped, then once again China is number one, exceeding U.S. And if you just ignore China, then that will just question your management ability. So that's how important China is now. And our advancement in China. Well, we do have the Alibaba.com \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Alibaba Group and ourselves. And Alibaba.com is overwhelming number one in B2B e-commerce in China. And today actually, page 70 you can see \\xe2\\x80\\x93 maybe you can just imagine how tall the bars will be. That means about 110 million users. And the Taobao transaction scale, how much will it be? Last year it was \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion. And this year it's a little less than \\xc2\\xa53 trillion, I believe. And if you sum up all the sales of department stores in Japan, then that number will be exceeded by Taobao in a couple of years. That is my assumption. In social network which has a significant service called Facebook. And this is actually the second growing and second important field in the Internet business next to the Internet. And the Mixi, mobile game, there are many in Japan as well. And just like that, Xiaonei is the Chinese version of those. And it has about 80% something of the share in China, Xiaonei. And it has already 56 million users. And Japan's biggest social networking service is a little over ten million. So you can see how big Xiaonei is. And also it's growing very fast. And its 100% subsidiary Kaixin has started at the end of last year. And for the last two years, it has doubled its user's base. So now it's 20 million and it was doubled in the last two months. And this is the 100% subsidiary of the OPI. And SoftBank is, in substance, top shareholder of this OPI Group which runs Xiaonei and Kaixin. And my gut feeling tells me that Kaixin will exceed Xiaonei shortly. But in any way, Xiaonei and Kaixin both are under the OPI management and we, SoftBank Group is the top shareholder of OPI Group. So B2C, Taobao and Alibaba.com and the payment service Alipay, all of them are very prominent and they are blooming in China. And actually the number of the users is bigger than the number of total credit card users in China. So here you can see SoftBank is heading for number one Internet company in Asia. And we have a good preparation for that already. That is all for about my presentation today. And we'd like to become the lifestyle company in the 21st century and I gave you a presentation about our earnings results and our direction. Thank you very much. \",\n",
       " '2009 Q2': \"I am Son of SoftBank, thank you for coming today. Last year I announced that year was the genesis year of the Mobile Internet. And the mobile phone is going to be changing to mobile internet machine from voice machine. And that was actually lot SoftBank was aiming for and that was the biggest reason we decided to acquire Vodafone Japan. And now we are at the stage that we feel that is really happening and compared to the past. Just mentioned that the last year when I compare to the current the month \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the handsets sold in the month were increasing by several by not some percent but, actually some 100% increase. So it's selling very well. It's increasing and the speed of the sales is accelerated actually, so the volume is increasing substantially. Myself, I am using this iPhone everyday basis. It's really convenient. And I believe that this time of the stage will come and I think it came reality and that this will be the core business of the SoftBank and I believe in that. And that's why we have spent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have spent \\xc2\\xa52 trillion to acquire Vodafone Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 K.K. And I believe that actually bring down the share price of SoftBank at the time of announcement about 60% of the decrease was seen in the share price. So the condition of Vodafone K.K was a big risk and there are many peoples thoughts that it has a high possibility of fail, so and never be able to repay the debt. So people will \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there are rumors that SoftBank is about the ending of the business and that kind of things has been discussed in stock price \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no stock market. But actually when you see the result of the earnings this time you can tell that was not true. Actually the future of the mobile Internet is coming very close in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for SoftBank, this is going to be the big contribution to the business of SoftBank and also become the core business of the SoftBank. And I think you can feel that from our performance and we've been spending close to \\xc2\\xa52 trillion in cash and most of the source of that is coming from the loan and repayment of this debt. As I commented early this year that we keep the pace for the repayment or even faster than the pace I commented. And I think you can feel that from the announcement for earnings results today. So I would like to go into the presentation now. So, first of all, just a one word, as a conclusion, record high profit. And how did we make the record high profit? The breakdown is here that there are nine record high results. First is the EBITDA in the Europe, our U.S. EBITDA is more focused than the operating income, ordinary income. And we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is seen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 recognized as an important index and actually we had this EBITDA record high for six consecutive periods. Operating income and ordinary income both are record high in four consecutive periods. Net income, operating cash flow, free cash flow and even in operating income of main businesses those are all making record high results. The growth as you can see on your right hand side, it's making two digit growth there. So early this year, free cash flow, I mentioned in over three years we will be something close to \\xc2\\xa51 trillion cash free cash flow. In this forecast of ours same more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we can say this forecast is more confident and I'll have to explain you why we have such confidence here. First of all in the beginning of this year, we made a free cash flow forecast of \\xc2\\xa5250 billion and today we raised the forecast by \\xc2\\xa550 billion from 250 to \\xc2\\xa5300 billion as of today. So we're expecting \\xc2\\xa5300 billion free cash flow forecast for this fiscal year. In the past few years, we haven't made any forecast but at this time that we went and put the forecast and that we are very careful about calculation for the forecast, so that we don't have to decrease the forecast amount. So we are quite confident with achieving this forecast this time raised. This \\xc2\\xa5300 billion free cash flow and here on this slide shows the breakdown. Actually there is no one-off free cash flow in here. Most of the part is something we can believe that it is continuously happening for the free cash flow. So our next year or the year after we expecting this \\xc2\\xa5300 billion for the free cash flow will maintained and we'll not go below this fiscal year \\xc2\\xa5300 billion, because we don't expect any one-off free cash flow in there. So \\xc2\\xa5300 billion times three years which is \\xc2\\xa5900 billion and also a few years ago that we already announced that we had a forward contract of the Yahoo! Inc. shares and that this \\xc2\\xa5100 billion is going to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I find it possibly as we count as a free cash flow for above \\xc2\\xa5100 billion. This is the Yahoo! Inc. share in U.S. for the forward contract, which is already made in 2004. So we are also quite sure that we'll be able to account this \\xc2\\xa5100 billion from Yahoo! Inc. shares. So \\xc2\\xa5300 billion at least that we can maintain and also we have some upside on top of that. So, 300 billion times three years plus 100 billion in total \\xc2\\xa51 trillion that we will be able to account as on the free cash flow. So in three years I have been mentioning that something close to \\xc2\\xa51 trillion over three years, but at this time starting from today I'm quite confident to say that more than \\xc2\\xa51 trillion over three years. So I would like to change the word for the forecast, so \\xc2\\xa51 trillion or more over three years. So I am quite confident with this number. So, there are some rumors that we will not be able to repay all the debt or the reduced net interest bearing debt. Especially last year November, December market was little a bit of critical about our situations, but actually we're being \\xe2\\x80\\x93 making the record high for four consecutive period, so those rumors or that those anxieties has no base for that. To just about the image, negative image that impacted us but actually we've been making record high for four consecutive months \\xe2\\x80\\x93 periods, excuse me, and even in the free cash flow, we're quite confident to be able to achieve \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. And at this moment I don't really see much of the company, who can say \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in free cash flow as an forecast. But we actually committing overall \\xc2\\xa51 trillion over three years. Page eight, is the detailed breakdown of the consolidated earnings net sales, EBITDA, operating income is increasing tens billions of yen. In the growth ratio shown in this slide, net sales operating income, ordinary income, net income, even in operating income we have increased by 28%, ordinary income 48%, net income 72% and free cash flow actually 146% increased, excuse me, total 460 times (sic) [14.6 times] . And the most of the competitors are announcing this decrease in revenue and profit but us SoftBank is announcing revenue and profit increase, especially this mobile communications business, I am assuming that the competitors are showing the decrease in revenue and profit but us we are showing increasing in 7% and 49% in net sales and operating income respectively. And actually the mobile communications is the driver for the overall performance and actually this mobile communications area is increasing even compared to the consolidated base. And the page 11, shows the annual full year forecast. So 420 of operating income and we keep that forecast for operating income in this fiscal year. But seeing the actual so far that we are quite sure that we will be able to achieve or even we can exceed the number. So we are targeting towards \\xc2\\xa5420 billion of the operating income for this fiscal year. Free cash flow, as I just mentioned it's just 300 billion and we have already achieved 177 billion of free cash flow and also \\xc2\\xa5230 billion of operating income for the first half of this year alone. Therefore the annual numbers we have already committed are very much likely to be achieved and we're very confident about that and the breakdown by segment that you can see it here EBITDA in the key segments we have achieved increase. And comparison with the past records especially for the last four years you can see our growth have been remarkable. And we have been achieving the record highs for six consecutive periods. And consolidated operating income, once again here we have recorded \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we had we achieved a record high and in key segments we have also achieved growth. And the page 16 talks about the annual trend of consolidated operating income. And here once again you can see we have achieved record high for fourth consecutive period. Compared to the five years ago after the start of broadband we have been struggling due to the investment in advance. And Japan Telecom also had investment in advance, but all those negative numbers have been turned to positive and they are contributing to the growth. And page 17 talks about the comparison with other company and DoCoMo has not announced its official results for the first half so it's not included here. But compared to the other operator who recorded decreases in revenue and profit we have been growing. And last year we had about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion difference for the first half and also the lines are also parallel. But for this first half, we are really closing in on KDDI, with good momentum. Just for your information for the last three months, so for the first quarter actually we had better number in operating income, as an actual result exceeding KDDI. And we are very happy about that. And ordinary income, once again, we achieved a record high and also the 80 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 48% increase. And page 19, talks about the comparison with the past ordinary income and the net income also grown by 72%. In the past we had special incomes or special factors, but for the last \\xe2\\x80\\x93 last year's first half period did not have any special things or any particular factors, but still we achieved this 72% increase for this first half. And last year we had the special loss in the second half, and we do not expect any similar kind of things coming in this second half this year. And the page 21 talks about the consolidated income and the page 22 shows a profit growth ratio, and you can see those growth in key factors, and also the growth have becoming bigger compared to last year on the half year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 first half year basis. EBITDA margin by segment, here you can confirm that we have a higher effectiveness in management. And next, I'd like to talk about the cash flow results. Compared to the last three years numbers on the half \\xe2\\x80\\x93 first half year basis, we have achieved three \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xc2\\xa5138.1 billion increase and free cash flow once again here we have achieved \\xc2\\xa5164.9 billion increase compared to the last year's first half. And actually this momentum is exceeding what we have anticipated that's why we decided to announce the upward revision as the free cash flow forecast. This \\xc2\\xa5250 billion has been revised upward to \\xc2\\xa5300 billion and breakdown of this \\xc2\\xa550 billion is actually from the improvement of operating cash flow. So out of the \\xc2\\xa550 billion, we're now doing the installment sale of handsets and in that so far we have been using the securities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have been using the installment receivables and collateral to borrow money. So when we have more and more sales of handsets then at the same time our borrowings go up. But those money is for sure to be paid by our customers, so we can correct them at the end, but schematically, the technical thought is it has a mechanism to bring up our borrowings. But \\xc2\\xa510 billion of installment receivables were directly sold this time. And so we now have a option to sell installment receivables directly. It depends on the market situation, but will have additional option to be more effective in terms of financing. And that will help us to reduce our net interest bearing debt and to expand our free cash flow. So we have a new option in our hand. So page 28, this year's free cash flow was forecasted \\xc2\\xa5250 billion and in next fiscal year and the following fiscal year we expect to have a bigger number. And if we have stayed with this forecast then we will have the 375 billion but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the \\xc2\\xa5750 billion. That means there is 100 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1,500 gap to the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. That's why we just made \\xc2\\xa51 trillion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 around \\xc2\\xa51 trillion forecast. But today, I really just revised the free cash flow to the 300 billion and if you multiply 300 billion by three then it's going to be 900 billion and the 100 billion of the Yahoo! Inc., shares forward contract will bring us \\xc2\\xa5100 billion most likely. So that amount is really a confident number we will be able to achieve. Why are we so confident and I'd like to use the pages from here to explain that. In the mobile business cash flow can be counted as a total cash income and this simple equation can show it. That means the number of subscribers, times average cash income per subscriber equal to total cash income. So total cash flow. Then, when we have a bigger customer base that will have a positive impact so it's very important. So the red bars here were when we were the Vodafone Japan, so it was like flat. But after it became SoftBank you can see there is stable growth obtained and those are gray bars. Now we have 21 million subscribers compared to the 15.2 million subscribers, so you can see we have made a stable and solid customer base expansion. And the source comes from net addition number one for consecutive months. So, next page talks about the cash income per subscriber. So when this cash income per subscriber goes down even with the customer base expansion, it's meaningless. But for the two and half years the cash income per subscriber has been constantly growing. Therefore the expanding customer base times the expanding cash income per subscriber it goes to \\xc2\\xa51.2 trillion in the fiscal year 2007. And in fiscal year 2008 it was \\xc2\\xa51.4 trillion. Two years ago the cash income per subscriber was \\xc2\\xa55,750 times 1.7 million (sic) [17.05 million] and last year it was \\xc2\\xa55,910 times 1.95 million (sic) [19.57 million] subscribers. And this year the average subscriber number will be 20.96 million for this fiscal year and the cash income is \\xc2\\xa55,930 so therefore we expect we will have more than \\xc2\\xa5300 billion increase of the cash income. So therefore \\xc2\\xa5300 billion times three years we'll be easily achieved and we are very confident we will achieve better number than that. So you can see the bar graph here 1.2, 1.4, and \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion, so you can see the steady growth of the total cash income. So the 3,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 300 billion is not really what we expect, we expect it would be bigger than that. So we will be able to reduce the net interest bearing debt and as I just mentioned at the beginning, iPhone sales are much better than we expected and as a result, data traffic are also growing. This is another factor we have to consider. The other thing is the 1.5 gigahertz license was granted officially this year. So including that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 including those two points in consideration for the second half of this fiscal year we would like to increase CapEx by \\xc2\\xa540 billion, I'd like to announce that today. But the payment of this \\xc2\\xa540 billion will be coming in next fiscal year, so even with the investment of \\xc2\\xa540 billion, additional CapEx this year we're not going to need \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we're not going to pay this year. So payment will be coming in the fiscal year 2010. And even with that negative figure, we'll be able to achieve more than \\xc2\\xa5300 billion of free cash flow for the next fiscal year as well. And now we are confident, after the internal review, so we have decided to announce the upward revision of the free cash flow forecast. So we'll be able to achieve the \\xc2\\xa5300 billion of free cash flow annually. But there might be some other proposals about the reduction of the net interest bearing debt. For the last 12 months, we have actually reduced the net interest bearing debt by \\xc2\\xa5300 billion, which is equivalent to the free cash flow coming in this fiscal year. So for the last 12 months, we have already made a reduction of about \\xc2\\xa5300 billion. In keeping this pace, as mentioned earlier, we'll be able to generate free cash flow more than we forecasted, and so that at the end of 2011, \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion of the net interest bearing debt, we will be able to halve that amount by the end of March 2012. So we're having steady steps towards reducing net interest bearing debt. So what we announced, that half of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 halving the net interest bearing debt and also bringing that down to zero of the net interest bearing debt, we believe that we are making a firm step towards the target. In last year October, there were some rumors that SoftBank was having financing problem, which has no base \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no reasons for that rumor. But this fiscal year 2009, 2010 these are the corporate bonds redemption schedule and amount. And on your right hand side bottom is the amount and on your left, these are the liquidities. Of the cash positions actually \\xc2\\xa5720 billion are in our hands, which includes the cash position and the unused portion of credit loan facility. So 720 we have and the amount to be repaid is 45, 20 or 34, so even we total all that, it will come to the 720 just about 100 or so altogether a bit above \\xc2\\xa5100 billion for the repayment. So we have abundant repayment resources available by having the \\xc2\\xa5720 billion, which is easily we understood. And coming to this page, CDS hit high in March, April even as if that the company is bankrupting or something like that. But actually, as I mentioned earlier, we're making record high profit for four consecutive period. So this is also something ridiculous situations that we are facing, but the market is coming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 calming down after then and we have been able to seeing that the reasonable trend indices \\xe2\\x80\\x93 credit spreads. 42 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 page 42 is the improvement in key financial indices and all of the indices have fairly been improving largely. In page 44, from here data shows by business and this is the mobile communications. Actually better than consolidated, the mobile communications are showing the revenue increase, 7% increase year-on-year and record high profit by 49%. On a consolidated basis, 27% of operating income increased but if you only look at the mobile communications, actually we have increased by 49%, 28% for the consolidated base but the 49% increase in mobile communications. And the one of the driver for such a great performance is the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is the TV commercials. I believe this has been well received so far, the White Family and father dog and the family members of White Family is Mr. Dante Carver, Kanako Higuchi and Aya Ueto that those are very popular amongst the market right now. And this chart shows the past 10 years of the TV commercial preference ranking. And the most preferred TV commercials are shown here in top 10 and actually three titles are ours, the SoftBank TV commercials. White Family series is actually down there, but the SMAP exceeds even than the popular White Family and hitting the number one position for TV commercial preference ranking, which is very happy news for us. Not only White Family, in addition to White Family, SMAP is also effectively functioning for PRs in getting the number one position. So this migration \\xe2\\x80\\x93 SMAP migration is the big impact of the SMAP members are coming down the stairs and these are the latest commercials. [TV Commercial] So this was the TV commercials by SMAP and the last one hasn't been broadcasted on TV yet. So these TV commercials are very popular and well accepted. And as a result, it's making quite a positive impact to the management and what is happening, as I'm keep saying the mobile Internet importance and we have a White Plan in SoftBank, which is the best price plan in the industry. And it is for SoftBank mobile users and they are free of charge for the voice call between \\xe2\\x80\\x93 up until 9 o' clock. So as a result that we see some declines in ARPU however, finally that this turned around last year fourth quarter at the bottom we've been able to increase or exceed the previous quarter for this first quarter and second quarter in the fiscal year '09. Of course, free cash flow is more important for our management but after we changed the business model and avoid those customers, who stop using handset within three months or six months, but as is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 due to those situations that there are some customers who has to pay more even that they're staying longer with our network. So we change the business model and the gap has been filled by this [inaudible] handset installment payments or the back-up service packages. And here is the ARPU comparison with competitors. You can see the trend of ARPU of the competitors. Year-on-year basis that the competitors, last year declining, but as finally even in the year-on-year basis we are making a big improvement so far And sometimes seeing that we are exceeding above zero yen, so it's making a big improvement. And the major contributor for all this is Data ARPU. Data ARPU keeps increasing and I've been saying that the mobile internet, why we acquired Vodafone K.K. its not the business for voice, but it's a business for data communications, and also for mobile internet, and that's why that we entered this market. And the biggest reason shown in here, Data ARPU making a steady progress and keep increasing which you compare from this page. The growth ratio of data ARPU is highest compared to competitors. And when we see by platform there are some examples, for example the internet shopping if you do some shopping through internet. Just a year ago, which is year 2007 but we compare to 2008 and 2007 for one year. And you can tell clearly that the pink portion is increasing. Those \\xe2\\x80\\x93 rather than using PC for the internet shopping but more people is doing shopping using mobile and the ratio there for the mobile platform only is increasing only in one year. And the next example is blog, this too only half of the people is going \\xe2\\x80\\x93 using \\xe2\\x80\\x93 making blog or using \\xe2\\x80\\x93 enjoying blog through PC. And SNS actually less than half people are using PC for enjoying SNS many more people are using mobile to enjoy SNS. In this situation we'll accelerate and the reason is because iPhone. As mentioned, I have been iPhone everyday for past one year and if you start using iPhone your frequency of using a PC is less than one-tenth, comfortably one-tenth even the one-twentieth the usage of the PC. So as mentioned 95% is coming from iPhone, I could \\xe2\\x80\\x93 used a example previously. So, when you say Internet, less people thinking its PC but I think they are not getting up the trend. When we first touched on PC we thought its going to be the PC centric age or period. It's not the paper calculations. So, it's not the calculator or nothing like that but PC would be the key for the further business. And that's why that we started the SoftBank business in 1995. I again, confident with this Internet period so that's why I started the Yahoo or E*Trade but that was actually true. But and then starting from last year that I mentioned the year of mobile Internet actually about five years ago that discussion was made and we started the preparations and even that we have filed a lawsuit with the government to get the radiowave to join into the mobile Internet market that was five years ago. And now that I can tell you that from my own experience Internet use, we have PC, it's less than 5% and the iPhone has become 95%. And I'm not any exception \\xe2\\x80\\x93 exceptional case. Most of the handsets from now are all becoming like iPhone. iPhone is not going to be a very special one or it's not going to provide us unique [inaudible] to it but all the other handsets will become just like iPhone that means mobile internet is going to be used for 95% of the use of the internet. So people just stick to PC to go on to the internet will be called as just a fossil. It's not me who is saying that, but people will say that and I am now experienced it first hand and for instance, you know Kaisha Shikiho Japan Company Handbook. And most of you here are in the financial business therefore I assume that you buy one copy of the Kaisha Shikiho. And maybe you have three copies one at office one, at home, one in the car and this Shikiho is very, very heavy and thick but you still have two or three copies, I assume. And its not just by the Kaisha Shikiho by Toyo Keizai but maybe by [inaudible] as well and you have a variety of the Kaisha Shikiho. But if you dare to carry such heavy ones then its better to have this application of the Kaisha Shikiho on your iPhone I do actually purchased this application as well to my iPhone compared to the thick paper version of Kaisha Shikiho. With this iPhone's application version of a Kaisha Shikiho which is light and which is more convenient. An iPhone application of this Kaisha Shikiho also has the older pages included, so you can read everything about it and you do not need the glasses for that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reading glasses for that because you can just expand the screen with your two fingers. It is just an example and now 85,000 applications are available. It's very close to the 100,000 applications and already 20 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two billion downloads have been made. And this is the other application as the e-magazine and weekly five-day and also Diamond and Newsweek, Zeus Magazines I actually read them on the iPhone. It's really enjoying just like the paper magazines, but I can tell you that it's more convenient. So, now we are living in that kind of time and next one I'd like to talk about is the virtual reality application. If you would just angle your iPhone using the Sekai Camera application to look up the space also buildings then you will find this comment coming up in the space, like the prices also information of some product. Say you can just aim things with iPhone and you will see detailed information or additional information for instance in Tokyo you can get information about temples. So this is augmented reality and for the corporate users market. Actually, our company has been seeing reduction in overtime work after using this iPhone, because you can read business e-mails by iPhone and it's very convenient and stress free. I have been explaining many things, but in one word I can tell you that, we recorded \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we achieved a record high profit. And this is not like a magic of numbers, we have, it's not just a one-off time good result, but as I just mentioned, this is a huge trend we are observing now. So, we can see it changing the tide, this is for sure. So, the business in which SoftBank believe, its now prevailing among the people. The mobile internet era has actually just started, we are at the entrance. And that brings us this record high profit. As a result, its not just like forceable efforts over, we have just inflated any numbers, but overall we just restructured, that's not the case. We didn't squeeze out these numbers its just increases in revenue and profit. And all those factors and indices we have shows a record high. And some people were just, were skeptical about the repayment of the debt. But we have actually reduced \\xc2\\xa5300 billion already. So we believe that maybe in fiscal year 2011, so at the end of the year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two years from now, we will be able to half the net interest in bearing debt, compared to what we had in March this year. But all companies do not exist just for creating profit, nor offer cosmetic numbers of earnings result. But we are aiming to become a lifestyle company in the 21st Century. This is not something we can go back to get. Japan once declared a electronic company. And Japan once achieved a great success in manufacturing. But it's not like we are coming back to that time. But we would like to be a part of the 21st Century companies and we would like to be unique in presenting us. And we will try to provide a new lifestyle in the 21st Century through people. And as a result of that kind of efforts we have renewed a record high. Thank you very much for your attention today. \",\n",
       " '2009 Q3': \"I'm Son from SOFTBANK. Thank you very much for today. And today is our earnings result announcement and I'm so happy. Why I'm so happy is that not only the good result of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this time, but at the same time, I believe and assume this is the first time in Japan for the announcement that we are live distribution in Twitter service and together with that we are providing a live video streaming in Ustream. I talked to a person that probably even in U.S. there was no \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there is no company making earnings result announcement using Ustream officially. So probably, this could be a first in the world to use this Ustream, the new technology that we're using, and enjoy the new communication method to share with you, which is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which makes me so happy, and that this meeting is on the Internet. And I'm using Twitter these days and I feel that what I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right after I tweet there are Korean, Chinese, English comments comes back right away. So not only to Japanese people, Japanese user, but also at the same time that my tweet is distributed to the worldwide and I can receive the feedback from those countries outside of Japan. In only the one click, it can be translated into Japanese in twit word. So, the circle of communication is beyond the time, beyond the boundaries, and beyond every languages and we can communicate to each other. So, people can talk to each other. And I'm really feeling the happiness of this and I'm especially feeling that with using Twitter's and other services. So from the sense, not only those figures of business resource, but also I am so happy to be able to share this time with you with those new technology and new communication methods. Now, I'd like to go into the presentation material. So we have two highlights, one is the renewed record high profit and also announcing operating income forecast for next fiscal year at \\xc2\\xa5500 billion. Usually, earnings results announcement over the fourth quarter or the fiscal year-end is a kind of timing for the forecast of next fiscal year's these kind of figures. But the last year, the previous fiscal year after the Lehman shock, the economy in the world has been collapsed and lot of investors and companies felt the anxiety and I believe that the same type of rumors were told in some media against SOFTBANK. So just a year ago, in the third quarter of last fiscal year, which is the time right after the Lehman shock that we announced the forecast on operating income for next fiscal year, until then for five to six years, SOFTBANK did not disclose any of the forecast for the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our business because we were not sure and we shouldn't \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we thought that we shouldn't make any disclosure with the uncertainty and we don't want to make any trouble to investors and because those businesses were very new and had to seek for new possibilities, at the same time new risks. So, that's why we didn't make any disclosure on the forecast of next fiscal year-end. We are very careful about that for 5 to 6 years. But because the current world is unclear and people are in anxiety that it's the time that we thought that we should make a forecast for the business. That's why that we decided to do so in last fiscal year third quarter, and because we did that in third quarter last fiscal year, so that's why that we made this announcement for the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the third quarter this year and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which is the \\xc2\\xa5500 billion for operating income in next fiscal year. And first is the earnings result in page five, from net sales to free cash flow, all the index, we're making a big improvement in each and making a record high profit, with lot of people's support that I am \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so appreciate that we can share these figures with you today. And more specifically, compared to the last fiscal year, earnings forecast 366.3 billion, so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which is quite big in operating income and also \\xc2\\xa5283.5 billion for free cash flow. And for your reference, NTT DoCoMo, KDDI, our competitors, has already announced the earnings results. So I don't want to be too rude, but this is the competitor of ours, so I put some comparison table here. So compared to those two rivals, net sales and operating income, we were in increase of revenue and profit. So, we are doing everything we can and I believe that this is a result from that effort. Net sales in page eight shows the breakdown of net sales. In each, we made a good improvement. And segment-wise it's shown in here, and when it comes to the EBITDA, especially in other countries, EBITDA is focused compared to net sales, operating income and even in this EBITDA that we are making the record high figures. And actually, we're recording the highest for six consecutive terms. In operating income by segments, in every segment that shows the record high, so not only the one segment but in all segments it made a record high, as you can see from page 11, and here the record high for five consecutive periods. And this is the time graph, this KDDI comparison, from four, five past years. And as you can tell that we would like to stretch the line, then that you will be able to see what will be, but anyway going to the ordinary income compared to previous fiscal year, it's a 61% increase year-on-year which is also the record high. Net income, again record high, 63% increase year-on-year. And the page 16 shows the net income and its breakdown. In this net income, we have recorded special loss because we are going to terminate 2G mobile phone and that will be happening in the end of March, but we have already clarified the loss that we are going to have for the fourth quarter, so we have recorded in third quarter. So, any loss that we would like to record as a special loss as soon as possible, that is our policy. Even in 3G, some equipments or facility we have replaced the vendor, and with that we believe that we will be able to have a efficient cost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 operating cost reduction, so not wait until the time but we would like to record in the third quarter. So together with that, \\xc2\\xa546.8 billion loss on retirement of non-current assets has been recorded. And with this record and still, we were able to make 63% increase in net income year-on-year. So if we didn't have this one temporary special loss, net income is actually higher. Operating cash flow, 73% increase year-on-year. And looking in the past two years, record high in the free cash flow, six times year-on-year basis. SOFTBANK is often that this is a big debt company, too much debt so may have a bankruptcy, that kind of rumor has been told. But in reality, we're making big free cash flow, and in this third quarter \\xc2\\xa5280 billion free cash flow, which is all the taxes, CapEx are deducted and cash revenue will beat \\xc2\\xa5280 billion, which is times six year-on-year. So in total \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in summary nine record high results are able to reach. So in each item we were able to make a big improvement in record high. And I've been talking about several times that as an \\xe2\\x80\\x93 problem and which has been pointed out that the net interest bearing debt is a kind of a problem for SOFTBANK, and from the end of 2008 in the comparison graph here in page 23, is \\xc2\\xa5370 billion has been reduced in net interest bearing debt. Especially in Mobile business, our acquisition of Vodafone K.K., about \\xc2\\xa52 trillion cash acquisition was made back then and with that the big loan was made. So our Mobile Communications business here has less than \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of the borrowings. And for the coming months \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the last months, we have already repaid about 100 billion in total. And you can see, we have a very \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have intention to keep a high balance of cash and cash equivalents and also the credit line facilities, and together it's about \\xc2\\xa5720 billion which is very much affluent. And on the right bottom, you can see our schedule of the redemption of bonds and also the amount. So as you can see, we do have abundant cash position. So, here you can see the improvement in key financial indices. As a result, for the first time in six years, our rating has been upgraded. Well, if you just compare to others, then this is just like this. And next highlight, as I just mentioned at the beginning, next year, fiscal year 2010, our operating income forecast is over \\xc2\\xa5500 billion and this is official announcement here. For the last 30 years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this year marks the 30th anniversary of foundation of this company and if you look at the trend for the last 30 years, this is just like that, and especially for the first 15 years you cannot really spot the bars on this graph. The biggest dent was when we started the Yahoo! BB infrastructure service. And we boldly challenged NTT that was a giant, and a small company like us at that time challenged it and that challenge brought us to a leap later. Well, it was like walking on a thin ice, but I do look back that with a great feeling of success. So it was a good choice. And for the next fiscal year, the operating income will exceed \\xc2\\xa5500 billion. That means compared to the focus of other companies for fiscal year 2010 and then where are we going to be situated, and that is actually maybe we'll be ranked higher depending on other companies' performance. And now our CapEx, as we have already announced this, you can see we are following the schedule. I have just started using Twitter and I have got good support and there was good criticism. And some people say, we need to improve the coverage. And I do take them sincerely, and I just renewed my commitment to my business. I do have a very strong resolution to that. And at the Board meetings and also at the management meetings, we do discuss this very seriously. And this is the top priority and I am taking the lead in this. So for the fiscal year 2010, we will actually bring up this CapEx than the past pace. The amount is \\xc2\\xa5300 something billion is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 might be the scope. While the finalized amount is still under discussion at the moment and we are working on it, it's not just the amount of money we are going to use but new methods and also new technologies are also under discussions. And we are discussing it very seriously. So, I'd like to invite you to watch our results and we have a strong commitment to achieve it. So we are going to invest more on CapEx and at the same time as we've already made on commitment for the free cash flow over the coming three years, and that is \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, and this is also in the responsibility of the management. Once we made a promise, we have to fulfill it. And we will achieve that without fail. And then again here is another commitment, that is zero interest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 net interest-bearing debt. In the fiscal year 2014, net interest bearing debt is going to be zero and this commitment is not going to be wavered, we will achieve it. This is a comparison among three mobile operators, and here you can see net adds comparison and ARPU comparison as well. Business highlights of the Mobile Communications; first about the net additions. Compared to other companies, we have achieved number one position for two years in terms of net additions. At the time when we acquired Vodafone Japan, there was a big voice of concerns and I myself had certain uneasiness, but as a result you can see it here, we have achieved number one in net adds for two consecutive years. The red bar here shows the Vodafone Japan's time and the grey bars are what we have done after it become SOFTBANK. So before the acquisition it was almost flat, but after the acquisition you can see the business has been very different and more customers joined \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have joined to our service, which led to the higher net additions. And as I just mentioned before, the 2G service is going to be terminated at the end of March this year. And we have already promised this with the Ministry for the Internal Affairs and Communications. So, we are going to do so. We will keep our words. And in March, there are still customers on 2G service who are not going to migrate on our 3G service and that might be around 300,000 or slightly over. So, that number of customers of 3G service will terminate the service \\xe2\\x80\\x93 their contact with us, but still we would like to achieve the net addition in positive territory. So, second generation service is going to be terminated and the 300,000 or over customers are going to churn, but still in accumulation the number of subscription will be increasing. That means it's not going to be less than what we have today. That is something we are going to achieve. And as for the telecom revenues \\xe2\\x80\\x93 telecom service revenue, what is going to happen? The number of the subscribers may have certain impact because of the termination of the 2G service, but for the amount of revenue, those customers still on the 2G service are mainly prepaid customers. That means those customers do not use their mobile phones so often. People who use mobile phone service often have already migrated to 3G service. Therefore, it's about 1.7% in the total revenue and it's going to be lower in the coming two months. So maybe about 1% impact will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 might be made to the revenue, but if you think about the income, we are going to terminate the 2G service and that means we do not need any maintenance and operation of 2G service in terms of cost. So, it's going to give us efficiency in reduction of cost. So the next fiscal year, this termination of 2G service is a positive factor to increase our revenue. Now all the players are working on the net addition acquisition and net addition raise, and here you can see the TV commercial preference. Only for the last three years, including all different kinds of companies, beverage or car or electronics, among all those different industries we have achieved the number one preference ranking for the last three years. Especially last month, among 4,492 pieces of TV commercials, from the top 213 SOFTBANK's production has been ranked and that number is five. So five production of SOFTBANK were ranked among the top 13. But the amount of the money we spent is really smaller, but still we are enjoying this preference ranking. And from the top 213 you can find five of our products. And this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 here it comes, the newest TV commercial. When you get stuck, just keep working. Don't look back, be a man. Just go forward. You talk big, [inaudible]. So we are going to have the campaign to give a way, walking farther, maybe it's kind of a trifle thing but we are enjoying it ourselves too. So, we are still making a good effort. And here you can see cash income per subscriber and the breakdown is on this page. The APRU in accounting, so that does not include the price of handsets, and this is the graph to talk about it. As we can see, in their fourth quarter last year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 last fiscal year, that was the bottom. And for the next first quarter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 next fourth quarter, fourth quarter usually have a seasonal impact and also the access charge adjustment for that full year are going to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 happen. So usually fourth quarter has a drop, but that is just a seasonal factor. Please do take it as I just explained. So a basic trend, in the past ARPU was just going down but it hit the bottom and now turned around. Compared to other companies that's on this graph is NTT DoCoMo and Orange, there is KDDI au, and we alone has the bigger number year-on-year. We only \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are the only one who enjoys the increase of ARPU. And the biggest factor behind that is the data ARPU. So the voice ARPU is dropping because of the fierce competitions, but this data ARPU increases actually covers it and our data ARPU has grown much further than the others, that's why. And next, I'd like to introduce the fixed-line business contribution. For the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for 100 years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about 100 years, the country of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the government of Japan gave exclusive rights to only one company for the telephone service, so that was a licensed company. So, that means there was no competition and that was for the NTT. And for KDDI, it used to have exclusive international call service, but compared to those two companies, SOFTBANK is 100% private and we are actually new to this field, less than ten years, and our customer base is much smaller, but if you think about the size of profit then we are now number one exceeding those two. As prior to the Mobile business, we had a broadband business and the fixed-line has launched, but that was told that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or criticized that, that was a big failure, but actually as a result even in the fixed-line business we were able to become number one in income. One \\xe2\\x80\\x93 another thing or even more importantly is the slides showing going forwards. The first generation of the Internet was spread worldwide, but these days Web 2.0 or the second generation of Internet is told and people try to spread their own information and that is spreading rapidly. So, that is kind of a business that we're talking about. And in this Web 2.0 world, we are focusing on these three business; one is the OPI in China; and social network application on a social network in U.S. number one, RockYou; and today as we are using and providing live streaming, which is the Ustream. So it's those three companies, we the SOFTBANK became the top shareholder \\xe2\\x80\\x93 substantial top shareholders and I would like to go into details. OPI, which I have already announced last year and will have some additional explanation later on in the separate pages. So now that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I would like to go into RockYou first. In the past one to two years mainly that we were focusing on the Mobile, but the time of the investment in RockYou we were not making any fuss where we're trying to be quiet. RockYou as a matter of fact is the largest social application providers in the world like Facebook, MySpace, Hi5, Friendster. So the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 RockYou is providing those kind of places. And the number of users exceeds 250 million people. This is not just registration, but not using customers, but this is the numbers of active unique users in a month and visitors' number that's exceeding 250 million. So you can see the graph that how rapidly growing it is in past two years. So to this company that we became the top shareholder. This RockYou and SOFTBANK has jointly invested to RockYou Asia. In this RockYou Asia, SOFTBANK has 53% investment ratio and we are the majority in going to Japan, China, Korea. So in those areas, they have started the e-service providing. And the one example, that is five days ago MOVA Game Town, this RockYou application, has launched. So in five days, number of users became 500,000, only in five days, how rapid it is for the growth. And the second company that we focus is the Ustream as I mentioning earlier. What is great about Ustream, you may ask. So far, the terrestrial TV stations has an allocated frequency. So, in one city or one area, excluding NHK, only about five key stations channel was provided \\xe2\\x80\\x93 providing service, but has to have big equipment facilities and sending \\xe2\\x80\\x93 transmitting the radio which is [inaudible] of heavy facility is needed. But when it comes to Ustream, even general users, consumers, all the customers, all the consumers can be a sender of the information \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and when it comes to the text, it's the Twitter they're doing, but when it comes to the live streaming it is Ustream that can make it available. So in the era of Web 2.0, Twitter is equivalent to a newspaper and Ustream is equivalent to TV stations. Like President Obama in U.S., making a state opinion and a lot of users looked at this web streaming and they share the passion in this live streaming that at the same time users can exchange the message using Twitter. So, not like one-way media, but this is the interactive or by directional communication, the web is available in worldwide. Number of users in Ustream, you can see the graph that how big growth that it is making in two years, 50 million in the world and the monthly viewers exceeding 50 million. Within this year, it may be exceeding 100 million. And those people can be real-time bi-directional information exchange is available and they can watch the live distributions, live streaming, and you also enjoy the Twitter. So that's quite exciting things. The last Friday we made our first investment made, and we have option rights for the additional investments. So once we execute all that, then that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the investment ratio will be exceeding 30% which will make us a top shareholder. And the evolutional change of live streaming that I would like to actually use iPhone to show you the demonstrations for Ustream and myself like to show you how that works. So now that I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 pressing the Ustream icon and here you can start the Ustream, only the one touch, one click, other than that I don't do anything. And here that's already distributing, you can see that it's already being connected. So I'm shooting Mr. Kasai now. So can you tell me how the SOFTBANK cost will be for this year? We've got to do for this year. This is the motto for team, so we are trying to get the championship this year. Thank you very much for your comment. So that's how it works. So with the simple operation and only one touch, with one iPhone that you can be the sender of the informations and you can be the stations for the informations. So like a sport, three singers, they can be information senders or originator and can share the information with live streaming and with \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 using Twitter so that you can exchange your opinions and receive the feedbacks. That was the Ustream demo. And as I'm \\xe2\\x80\\x93 keep saying that we'll be making good net additions and the business results along with that is seeing a good performance, and the biggest elements from that is coming from iPhone. iPhone is still strong and selling well. At the time of announcement in iPhone in Japan that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we made announcement that we're going to be the seller of the iPhone, some experts, some media said that the iPhone will not be selling in Japan and some people said that actually. And you can see the result now, it's completely wrong. And I want them to admit that, that comment was wrong. No one said function \\xe2\\x80\\x93 iPhone will not be sell \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sold or if you don't have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 too big or if it's less batteries that the people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 made a clear statement that the iPhone will not be popular in Japan, but actually in amongst the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all the handset models, actually this was the biggest hit and biggest seller. The iPhone was the number one seller in 2009 and the second handset sold was the 830P by SOFTBANK and the third was the Sharp handset by au, and the fourth was the Sharp handset of DoCoMo, and the fifth was au's Y64-S. So in past one year, amongst the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all the handsets sold in the market, and iPhone was the biggest seller. And so that comment which \\xe2\\x80\\x93 iPhone will not be sold \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will not be popular in Japan was completely wrong. Actually it's growing, the number of sales is growing and last month it's selling very well. Year-on-year basis I believe that the Japan is making biggest improvement in sales compared to the last year for iPhone sales. So making good improvements, good performance, not like \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some 10%, but some several 100% of increase has been recorded like Twitter, Ustream, those kind of application will be coming one after another. So more and more that the iPhone is going to be essential and iPhone is the reason why that you can use application so smoothly. And I believe that this feeling can be shared amongst many people, and in 18 months, at the most \\xe2\\x80\\x93 exceeds three billion downloads has been made. In Twitter's that the users \\xe2\\x80\\x93 number of users is estimated exceeding five million. So, there are lots of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 lot of kind of Twitter application is available in iPhone. Another big team is China or Asia, especially for China we had a big initiatives in there. This year, unfortunate for Japan, but the GDP of China is going to exceed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we assume that, that is going to exceed that of Japan. So Japan will be the number two \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Japan was number two for a long time, but China will become number two \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the China would \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is exceeding Japan, so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but we shouldn't just be sad about that, but what I'm telling to my employees or executives, I always say that our economy in Japan is growing and our population is also growing. And so like our powers are always \\xe2\\x80\\x93 capabilities are always great. So that's how I tell to my employees. But our country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's not only Japan actually, that we have Japan and China into the world, a world of our country. So if we see that China included into our area, then that is expanding rapidly, so we should be in positive view, then that we can always find the business chance or business opportunity. So assuming some time this year, China's Internet population will be twice as much of that of U.S. Last year Internet population in China was 1.5 times as much of U.S., so this year I'm assuming that it will be twice as much. In SOFTBANK, Alibaba Group, and OPI Group is kind of a main focus for us to do the development of business in China. And these several announcements that I was not able to touch on the China matters, but this time because the situation has been settled after the Lehman shock, so I would like to talk about the positive things with China matters. Alibaba Group has five subsidiaries. And one of the businesses, which is a B2B business, of Alibaba Group has already gone public. Now it's about \\xc2\\xa51.1 trillion market cap. This B2B business in the Alibaba Group is actually not the core or the biggest or the most important business. There are bigger and higher value businesses in this group, that is Taobao. So now I'd like to introduce you Taobao. All the total of the Japanese companies are 4.2 million and the number of the users of Taobao is 45 million. So, it's about 10 times bigger than the total number of Japanese companies. This is just for the B2B company, B2B business, and that is 45 million of the users and please enjoy the feel. [Advertisement]. So, that was about the B2B business of Alibaba and that is increasing very rapidly. And I'd like to talk about Taobao. The total online shopping in China actually gives away the 70% to Taobao. So Taobao has a 78% share. There are many competitors, but this one company has about 80% of market share and Taobao is the only one who enjoys this overwhelming position in a big company, not Amazon in U.S., not eBay in U.S. There is a much smaller market share in a smaller segment, but the Taobao has this great market share. And the gross merchandise volume here, the Chinese cost of living is lower than Japan, but still it's already exceeded the \\xc2\\xa53 trillion in terms of the gross merchandise volume and the Rakuten, I believe, in Japan is about \\xc2\\xa5800 billion, I assume. So compared to that, Taobao has about just \\xc2\\xa53 trillion. So you can see how big that size is. And you can see this rapid growth on this graph. Why is Taobao so successful? First, it has overwhelming number of products available and the second, they guarantee the safety of a transaction and they have the buyer settlement methods too. And here more specific, Rakuten has 48 million articles and Taobao has about 400 million articles or items they trade. So that number is sheer overwhelming. For instance, accessories in Rakuten, it's about 400,000 and Taobao has 2 million. Net worth abundance also of any kind is available on Taobao. And how about books and magazines and the comics, Rakuten 3.2 million and Taobao is 58 million. So it's about 20 times bigger. And next one is about the women's clothing and it's selling very well. And Rakuten is about 1.2 million items and Taobao has 33.7 million, which is about 30 times bigger. How people can buy those items? I would like to tell you briefly. For instance, in ladies fashion, clothing for women, okay, you decide you would like to buy one, then on the left you can see the suppliers' information and the color, size in the middle, and on the top you can see the price. Let's go through and buy one, and here is the system for safe transaction, which is more advanced than Japan's method and maybe than American's method too, because here you can see the mark of guarantee of quality of the product and here you can see seven, that means seven-day return policy. And here is another mark guaranteeing the content of listing, that is this red \\xe2\\x80\\x93 yellow icon. And also, here is buyer's protection, so if the payment is not made, then Taobao will protect buyer and supplier will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will no longer able to use the service. And for the settlement, you buy, you pick up the item and you just put it in your card and you can buy it. On the left, you can see the information of the item and on the right you can see the address, item's board and shipping method and various things. And the settlement, you can use Alipay, pay with Alipay. And how you can put the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 deposit the money to Alipay, from a bank account you can just remit the money to Alipay account, or a debit card is also available, or the convenient \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or a prepaid card at convenience stores, so various methods of payment are available to deposit money to Alipay. And from that Alipay account, the money of the product, or the payment of the product, is going to be automatically withdrawn. That means people with balance in Alipay account will be able to do transactions on here, so 100% sure for payment of cash for the price of products. On the left, you can see the price of products, and you can see how much you can use, depending on the balance of the money in the Alipay account. And here Alipay information, Alipay's users is 270 million and compared to the total number of the credit cards issued in China, sometimes people do have more than one credit card, so the number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the actual number of the users of a credit card is less than the number of the card issued. But Alipay's case, it's a unique person, because they have to keep a good balance in the account. So 270 million Alipay users, and the total number of the credit card issued is 175 million, so you can see how big Alipay is. And that is a biggest agent for the settlement of purchase. And Alipay has the tie-up with all national banks. And maybe you have a certain negative image about the Chinese banks, but actually those are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 top three Chinese companies are ranked as number one, number three and number six in the world. So they are very formidable and solid and robust banks. And here are the five steps of Alipay's service model. First, a buyer orders online and buyer pays to Alipay and supplier ships order and buyer confirms delivery and then, for the first time, the payment is going to be delivered to supplier. So, after the confirmation of products delivery, the money is going to be withdrawn. So, buyers and suppliers will be able to make transactions with ease, no bad debt. So, this is a very secure and safe settlement. Therefore, Alibaba Group is growing roughly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's not just to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only to list items online, but the infrastructure in total is well established. And next I'd like to talk about OPI. Well, this OPI is talked that this maybe [inaudible], Facebook maybe the bigger one than the MySpace in the States, but this OPI has the Renren and Kaixin. We'll show the video of Renren. [Advertisement]. So this is about the girls who used to be good friends when they were students, and they just broken up now but they connected once again on Renren. And this kind of a story is really happening on Renren. So first it started a connection among university students, just like the Mixi or Facebook, Mixi in Japan and Facebook in U.S., but the difference is the growth rate of Renren. As I just compared Rakuten and Taobao, and now I'd like to compare OPI with Mixi. Mixi is the biggest in Japan. Mixi has about 18 million users and Renren has 120 million people and it's still growing rapidly as the graph tells you. And the Renren service is the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 China's largest SMS. It started with the university students and over 95% of the university students have account of Renren and most of them uses their real names and their real photos and even after graduation, they are still keep in touch. There are about 20 some millions, but they don't quit this account and they became the new white colors, so that this service has been spread not only in the university students, but also the white colors. As a result, there are about 120 million users. So, it was originally within the school or inside of school, Xiaonei, but after then \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's beyond school. So now that it's people to people, it's called Renren. So for example, if you enter the Beijing University student, then that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you'll be able to find your friends in Beijing University right away. And using the real name and the real photo \\xe2\\x80\\x93 face photo are mostly used, so that you will be able to communicate and also you can have some clubs and expand circles or communities. When it comes to the school \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sorry that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 company, then that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you enter the China Mobile, something like that, then that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you can find your colleagues in China Mobile using Renren, so just one second that you can find your colleagues in China Mobile and can go out together or can do some activities together. Diaries, feedback from friends, those kind of things can be exchanged, and the photo \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as a matter of fact, more than 2 billion pictures are uploaded in this site which is a great number. And also can enjoy the game together with friends, fun or the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a lots of games there, and also has item charging, so they have already turned in black. Also lots of variety of other games are ready and then prepared and provided, and that is also expanding to mobile phones, so it's shifting towards the mobile, overall does well. And now you can see on the left-hand side of the sub-screen that you can see the Twitter comments tweets. So after my comments, that there are lots of twitter users feeding back to us. So Renren will be connected to mobile so that you can use us as like Twitter that you can make comments or enjoy a game together or enjoy the Ustream type of service even in China. In the game market \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or game software market, Japan was very popular with these game areas that are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these red lines are the total number of games, but [inaudible] the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only the online games in China, that's the dotted lines in graph, so only the online games in China has exceeded the size of Japan of the total number of games and that's already the reality. And you can see the angles, how growing is that and also you can imagine how that will be, that big it is. So this is the social network and social game, so enjoy together and communicate with your friend, share the joys. Those kinds of things will be available. And why SOFTBANK is focusing in China so much is because \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about a few things. Some 10 years ago to succeed in Internet world, you have to be a company in U.S. because number of users of Internet or the 50% of number of users in Internet was English or the Americans. So you have to write English in English and you have to understand the culture of U.S. So to be successful in U.S., you have to be using Yahoo! U.S. or Amazon or eBay, Ustream, whatever, so many companies, but all of the companies in U.S. and that is because customer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 50% of customers were American back then \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Internet populations, 50% of Internet population was American back then, but now this situation is drastically changing. And now this year, the Internet population of China will be twice as much of that of U.S. and that will be happening this year. So, if we include all Asia in five years I would say the Internet population of Asia will be 50% of the world and the Americans or people in U.S. would be only 12, which used to be 50%. So customers in China or customers in Asia and providing the informations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 providing service. And if we provide English service or American culture service, then that will be very difficult. So, that was totally the same situation back then that how difficult it was for Asian people to provide a service in U.S. So it's totally vice versa and that will be happening. So, in all the segments of Internet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or the number one company of those segments doesn't have to be or not necessarily they can be the number one in the world. So not only the U.S. companies can be the number one company in Internet area, it's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually it's going to be changing in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more to say that a high possibility is that that the championship or champions will be coming from China. So, I would say that the winners in Asia will be winners in the world. And when it comes back to SOFTBANK Group, in the past one to two years, I rather be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 quiet about China and didn't make much of the comment, but in reality a year ago SOFTBANK Group, Alibaba Group, OPI Group, Internet users in China was 300 million in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 total of SOFTBANK Group. So it's just a simple sum of those numbers on each. And in the recent figure, it became 600 million. So, one year before it was 300 million and one year before then it was 1.6, so 160 million; so it's making rapid growth in Internet populations of SOFTBANK Group. So without any doubt, the Japanese company having Internet company structure in China and becoming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some hundreds of million people there and we believe that we will be the only one and even compared to the other industry like Toyota in number one automobile and they don't have a 600 million customers in China, not possible, like Sony or Panasonic Home Appliances or Shiseido of cosmetic, do they have a 600 million customers in China? No. But SOFTBANK, we are the leading shareholder or something close to that, that some of the customers as on SOFTBANK Group in China is now accounting 600 million. Alibaba Group and the OPI Group is not the only one that we are talking about. Actually those companies in this circle are all the SOFTBANK Group companies. So those are all companies that SOFTBANK has an investment and many of them are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are taking leading shareholder or something close to that, so that we believe that they will be making big improvements and also making good synergy each other. And of course not to mention that we have a lot of Japanese companies here in Japan, so a lot of companies close to Japan or in China. There are more than 100s Japanese companies. Those will be making good synergies each other and compete each other and making a good progress each other. And what \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I made that to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the most important company, which is Taobao, is the company that following the know-how and experience that I made in Yahoo! Auction and have a competition against eBay in Japanese market and also made 100% financing from SOFTBANK. So know-how, strategy and the money 100% transfer, and Alibaba Group executed the plan and had a 50% and 50% joint venture and we made it from scratch and that was with Taobao. So this is the synergy, we say. So if B2B \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if we were not a top shareholder of Alibaba, then that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we will not be able to make Taobao and if they didn't have us as an \\xe2\\x80\\x93 co-worker, then that they will not be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have a opportunity to start the Taobao because SOFTBANK was the one that made 100% finance, so that to Jack Ma of Alibaba I'd say that there is limitations (01: 10:19) of the finance. So we have to do until we win. So us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I made \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I trust this Jack, that if they don't waste the money then that I will provide the finance unlimited. So we will work or we will make a game until we win. So that was why that we started that joint venture with 50%, 50%. So the finance was coming from SOFTBANK for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from SOFTBANK, so first some years it was all red. So whole money has to record a special loss for those money of the investment. But now of course that it's making a good value and we recognize that, but it's the kind of good evidence that we were able to make a good synergy within the group. So Japan and China are making good success stories. So that is our Internet strategy and the strategy for China business development. So those are all coming from the mobile Internet. So it's not the fixed Internet anymore, but anytime anywhere that you can bring around which is the mobile phone or you can have a bigger screen sight of things that may be available sometime near future. So that will be evolving. So anytime, anywhere, with anyone, that in any situation that you will be able to be connected to your friends. So basic strategy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our basic vision is to be going towards the number one Internet company in Asia. So as I mentioned earlier, winners in Asia are winners in the world. So, the winners in mobiles are winners in Internet. So that is the basic vision and the strategy for us to develop the further business. And the reason why we do that is because we want to have all the people in 21st century to make them happy and also provide happiness, enjoy, so based on the philosophy that we were going forward with our business and this is the vision for this philosophy and the strategy for this vision. Of course, finance and many limitations are there, but within this that we would like to make every effort to achieve that goal. Thank you very much. That's all from me.\",\n",
       " '2009 Q4': \"I'm Son, thank you very much. While from the last announcement of the earnings result of SOFTBANK actually at that time, we actually announce the investment through Ustream. And today, actually we have quarter, so this is going to be like another page of history and to be recorded in your mind, I think. And when you talk about the announcement of earning result then it's usually invite journalists and analysts like you, that's the usual form I believe. But now announcement of earning result can be broadcast by Ustream. And also people who are watching the video on Ustream so that are ordinary people can make comments simultaneously on Twitter. So this is a new era we are in so the communication is not limited to mass media, it's not one way any longer but many people can join main communication at the same time and asking questions or posing their opinion. So that's where we are now. And myself actually about four months ago from the Christmas Eve last year, I started Twitter, and I'm using my real name and it has changed so much, my lifestyle have changed so much. So when I wake up in the morning, what do I do? And what do I do before I'm going to bed? So that part of my life has changed. And I actually Tweet as the first thing to do in the morning and I just browse other Twitters as well and I do the same before going to bed. I just check all those information to look where we are now. While the time have changed, I can say and when there is a new thing coming up, there are lot of people who criticize it. Well it's waste of time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's just wasteful \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think it was [inaudible] that she can't post or maybe again I don't remember but it talks about the demand of Twitter. So just like that, when there is a new tool coming up then there are people who just criticize it and I do appreciate the sins of criticism because it just makes the evolution going forward. But the intruder thing is you just give us because there are some issues you have to go over and you just stop developing yourself. That is a bad thing, worst thing. So you should experience this and you should come up with constructive ideas to improve that. That is the most important spirit and ambition I think to make the world a better place. So I myself try to capture the evolution in a positive manner and to make it useful for management and today you can see what I have captured from the Twitter and that is reflected in the announcements that we have done today. So this is just my prelude before talking about the announcement of the annual result. Okay. Well, this is our announcement of annual result. So maybe if not just like a vision, but first of all, I think I should talk about what kind of performance we made. And later, I can talk about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more about the future. So these are the highlights for today. Operating income was 465.8 billion. It's a record high and the second highlight for this new fiscal year, we have decided to invest CapEx of about JPY400 billion, so this second point actually was influenced greatly by the opinions on Twitter that I have been tweeting for four months. So this is actually reflecting basis of Twitter and I take those opinions straightforward and that we decided to increase the CapEx greatly and the details and how we are going to invest this CapEx are going to be touched on later. And of course I am President, I am the head of our listed company so there is another responsibility I bet, that is the payment of debt. Along with schedule we are going to reduce the net interest bearing debt. This was our equipment and we are going to keep it. This is part of management responsibility and I am going to talk about this later and that will be our third highlight. We got some of our net interest bearing debt and there is no changes at all in our plan and why are we going to achieve that because we are going to increase the CapEx and that is going to be explained later in this announcement today. Well just for your information, I just touched on a moment ago, so this clearly shows the Ustream hookup and you can also receive a tweet from 30 new people, so many people I'm making tweet. So people here this hall and also, many other people outside are using Twitter and also Ustream and they are making comment. And I just said the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our operating income was 465.8 billion which dropped by 38% year-on-year so that was an increase by 30%. And our free cash flow, as I just mentioned, we are going to repay the net interest bearing debt and this free cash flow is going to be the resource for repayment and our result was 390.8 billion which was doubled from the last year and this is another record high we achieved. And now, I would like to talk about the consolidated earnings results in detail. First, this is a summary of a consolidated earning result, as you can see it here from the topline, net sales to operating cash flow, free cash flow, net income actually exceed has surpassed the last year's figures and here you can see comparison with our competitors. KDDI already announced their results and NTT DOCOMO already had announced their forecast of annual result. So those figures are used in this table. We increased net sales and those of operating income greatly, so it's increases in revenue and profit. And next is our consolidated net sales breakdown \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so there's an increase and you can see the breakdown by segment here. And the consolidated EBITDA JPY787.6 billion, once again we achieved record high for the last five consecutive fiscal years. And this chart talks about consolidated ETBIDA by segment. Page 10, next is the consolidated operating income, it over JPY460 billion as I just mentioned. But if you look back five or six years ago, then we had a big number in red because of the FPB business pact and from there we have made a great improvement and we, once again meet our record high. And here you can see break down on the consolidated operating income. As you can see it here in all segments we have achieved increase in operating income but from this highlight of course it is in usual case sometimes you have bad segment and the good segment just cover them up but in our case all the segments have good numbers and we achieved a JPY460 billion operating income and if you look at the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all the industries in Japan then we are expanding where as one year ago, when we had a shock then there was a big \\xe2\\x80\\x93 big concern about the bankruptcy of SOFTBANK. And the markets talks about high possibility of bankrupt of SOFTBANK family JAL. So there are many articles about that, but actually one year and some months have passed and I tell you, we are ranked as the top three among all the companies in Japan, in terms of operating income for this banking. So if people say way SOFTBANK is going to bankrupt, then we argue we are number three and if that happens then what will have happen to a whole industry in Japan. So we have been paying back all our debts as scheduled and we are making a good result in free cash flow and operating income as well. And other companies, some of the other companies here haven't announced their actually numbers, but KDDI had already announced, so while we use the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 their forecast of result to make this working. So it's not just like we inflated the numbers or result. Okay, next is ordinary income, once again it's a record high JPY340 billion and it's almost increase of JPY100 billion year-on-year. Our next page talks about consolidated income and this was doubled year-on-year. And here is the breakdown of the ordinary income and net income and on the right from the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on the second right from the top, you can see loss on retirement of noncurrent asset JPY48.7 billion and also this amount is for retirement of equipment and the facilities of the 2G handset. And here the consolidated operating cash flow, so most of the source or the product free cash flow is coming from the operating cash flow that I could say, that this is a level, our outcome is explained in the 668 billion so compared year-on-year basis we were able to increase by \\xc2\\xa5200 billion, this again is a record high. Consolidated free cash flow, therefore free cash flow, we were able to increase by about \\xc2\\xa5200 billion and here one failed failed to record the high, so we were able to double [inaudible] \\xc2\\xa5390 billion, which as you all know before the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after the tax and as free cash flow [inaudible] that we were able to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 be in this level. And this is the launching industry in Japan and we were ranked number four. As you can see the automobile makers for two companies because they didn't, while they are not going to pay much of the tax because their financial report were in red. So that's why the debt free cash flow was better than ours, but as a reality, I believe that our \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are in a very good position here. In comparison with the competitors, mobile number portability and here is a competition, for mobile number portability in DOCOMO recording a negative 280,000 and minus 20,000 for [inaudible] and we're able to obtain positive 260,000 customers in SoftBank using number portability. And here ARPU, which is also important index for management. DOCOMO in a year-on-year basis, they are still having difficulty in the ARPU, but on the other hand in our case in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for latest two quarters, we were able to achieve or exceed the previous quarters. So for 2009, we were able to exceed the previous fiscal year in full year. So looking at the mobile operators in the world, exceeding the ARPU of the previous fiscal year. I believe, we were the only one or very few of the operators were able to do so. So from this, I believe that we were \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was very rare case that we are able to achieve this result. And here the mobile communication segment operating income, we were able to increase as a record high. Not totally the mobile business, but also the fixed line business. Again, that we were able to achieve \\xc2\\xa571.7 million, a record high number. About NTT East and West, we have 10 times as much of the subscribers than ours was only recording 45 billion, which is announced by NTT East and West. So compared to that figure because they have 10 times as much as subscriber, they have such positive database, should help us actually on merit from that, but perhaps having only one-tenth of the subscriber competing [inaudible] East and West. But again, here for the fixed line business we were able to attain the number one position and what's the difference, you may ask? So if NTT is not making good result due to the optical fiber investment and if they have such a heavy burden because of the optical fiber then they should be able to gain more better result by separating all these reduction, that's something that I like to tell you here. And I believe that's the kind of a structural issue held by NTT and they have some discussions. So again, installing the optical fiber maybe a burden for their financial report. In addition to that I am not sure that how many people here knows about this, but the NTT's net/all lines, by maintaining of course [inaudible] lines which cost them about \\xc2\\xa5300 billion per year. If this making \\xc2\\xa5390 billion of the maintenance cost for the metal line and also \\xc2\\xa5107 billion for the maintenance cost of optical fiber, if they can reduce this cost than that they should be able to get a financial result by a \\xc2\\xa5300 billion. So I believe that this move is to be reconsidered by our shareholders of NTT. But Japanese notion or the government is the major shareholder of NTT, which means that, our national popularity should focus that our NTT spending redundant cost on metal maintenance cost and optical or fiber cost which maybe double bargain for the nationwide of Japan. And here by segment, Internet culture mainly driven by [inaudible] this again making not any progress and record high for 10 consecutive results for years. In net interest bearing debt after the acquisition of Vodafone, at the peak time we had about \\xc2\\xa52.4 trillion and that has been reduced down to \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion. So close to \\xc2\\xa5900 billion reduction of net interest bearing debt. If this acquisition of Vodafone K.K. we had a large number of net interest bearing debt, which made uncertainty on the future of SoftBank and there are lots of conservations in the worries over the SoftBank. But, thanks to all that we are able to reduce net interest bearing debt favorably and now that we are targeting towards the down to their net interest bearing debt. They now have quite confidence about achieving their target. And the outlook for fiscal 2010, sustained revenue and profit growth trends and also increased CapEx significantly. So this \\xc2\\xa5500 billion operating income of course is the highest number and also that will be renewing the record high profit for six consecutive years and this over past 30 years of the bar graph [inaudible] income and you can see that how tremendously that we are able to increase operating income in past few years. And CapEx here, as mentioned earlier, that highest which is \\xc2\\xa5400 billion CapEx, so we will be aggressive in management. So this portion came from feedback and opinion from the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 due to the followers or the comments and I sincerely like to respond to those feedback and opinions which that we will likely turn into the profit management here. The increased CapEx amount by 140, previous fiscal year was 140 [inaudible] at this time we increased by 140. About 18 months ago free cash flow forecast was announced, at that moment fiscal 2008 free cash flow was \\xc2\\xa5140 billion that was the forecast pattern. So having the net interest bearing debt and that was another announcement that we made and that time free cash flow forecast was \\xc2\\xa5140 billion for fiscal year 2008 and actually was \\xc2\\xa5180 billion by increasing by \\xc2\\xa580 billion. And today as an announcement for earnings results, \\xc2\\xa5250 billion of the announcement and actually [inaudible] \\xc2\\xa5390 billion. For this additional free cash flow for past two years was \\xc2\\xa5180 billion. For \\xc2\\xa5180 billion free cash was the additional or incremental from the original plan or the initial plan. So this \\xc2\\xa5180 billion that the incrementally we were able to achieve that we would like to put it on to the CapEx that we are going to spend. So \\xc2\\xa5400 billion from the 250 instead of \\xc2\\xa5380 billion of the additions. So the total of \\xc2\\xa5680 billion is coming from the free cash flow. For what we earned is going to be spend to the CapEx. So this would be the incremental for the CapEx, plus the kind of contents for the management. So as we committed, we are going to make earnings and free cash flow and also making hub of the net interest bearing debt. So these commitments remains the same. So for three years that we are going to earn \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of the free cash flow, which I announced a year ago. So one-third \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we already made \\xc2\\xa5390 billion, so remaining two years that we need to have \\xc2\\xa5600 billion. So this time even that we add some CapEx amount but still in remaining two years \\xc2\\xa5600 billion free cash flow that that I have a confidence to achieve that target that's why that we made the [inaudible] enquiry announced this CapEx amount. In the latest addition was made from this incremental from past 18 months so that's why that we don't have any changes to the overall commitment. So at the time of the peak \\xc2\\xa53.4 trillion of the net interest and bearing debt at that time of the announcement \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion net interest bearing debt in this year. About 18 months ago was \\xc2\\xa59 trillion came down to \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion. For making half of that will be less than \\xc2\\xa51 trillion that will be some time fiscal 2011 that we would like to make \\xc2\\xa5 2billion of the net interest bearing debt and two years [inaudible] we would like to make it down to zero of net interest bearing debt. As a result dividend that [inaudible] we would like to increase for this fiscal year at annual general meeting of shareholders that we would like to have an official resolutions and we would like to change the dividend from 2.5 to \\xc2\\xa55.0. And after that 2011 when we decrease the net interest bearing debt that we would like to increase more and at the time of making down to zero of the net interest bearing debt, we would like to answer again increase the dividend, so dividend policy [inaudible] stays the same. So this is the conclusion of the financial part. Operating part \\xc2\\xa5465.8 billion, CapEx \\xc2\\xa5400 billion and also net interest bearing debt reduction targets remain unchanged. So this is the summary of the financial highlight. Now I would like to go into the discussions on how we are going to use this CapEx and what kind of things that we're going to do in mobile internet? So, first in the world, as of today, in this earnings results announcement there are one things that I would like to share with you, which is all of the operators in the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mobile operators in the world, we are the first one that turned around the data ARPU and the trend of the data ARPU against the voice ARPU has reversed, so data ARPU exceeded the voice ARPU. So this is, I believe, the SOFTBANK data first in the world mobile operator. First is that is shown on this slide, DOCOMO's data ARPU ratio is 44%, SK Telecom the number one in the South Korea is at 35%, SingTel 32%, and the U.S. biggest mobile operator Verizon Wireless is at 32%. And there are other players in Europe and in Asia, so they have a smaller failure around 10%. And we are the first one who have exceeded 50% in terms of that data ARPU ratio. So I trust that we have increased data ARPU year on year for the first time in the row, which is just [inaudible] the voice data \\xe2\\x80\\x93 voice ARPU. Okay. Let me look back, in 2001, we enter the new field. We didn't have infrastructure but we bravely decided to go into our broadband service, so we had a \\xc2\\xa5900 billion in red for series of years. But we had high ambitions at that time. We wanted to transform the lifestyle of the people with broadband service. So we had reckless challenge at that time. And that time I thought that SOFTBANK would go bankrupt if we would make errors or mistake because we are 100% private company in Japan and that was a very reckless challenge. So my management liked, business liked with the ending. But still I wanted to do this because [inaudible] developed countries in Japan. Japan has it lowest broadband service and also the lowest penetration of the Internet and I wanted to transform the country to be number 1 in the world in the speed and also in penetration. And here is the result of our effort. So now we are right number 1 in terms speed and price, the lowest price. If go abroad and if you try to connect to Internet then you can see that very depressed level and that can be realized for the first time when you go out of Japan, it's just like a child if you understand the business [inaudible] independent. So in Japan it's just a matter of fact and it's just natural to enjoy 3G and broadband that [inaudible] low price and high speed those are taken as for granted. And of course, people would like to have better, higher speed under the lower price. But we achieved the large top broadband environment and that is basic ambition for the broadband service. And in 2006, we acquired Vodafone KK and at that time we wanted to acquire mobile Internet. It's not about the mobile telecommunication, it's not telephone company we were interested in, but we wanted to have mobile Internet and we wanted to change, transform lifestyles of people through the mobile Internet, that was our ambition. And that's why introduced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we released iPhone and also other internet services and the mobile phone. And [inaudible] iPhone was going to be sold well and there were so many experts who talked about that. [inaudible] is essential. And is because that Japanese mobile phone are sophisticated, so iPhone is not going to be sold very well. And that kind of attitude were everywhere and so many experts were talking about that with large voice. And as [inaudible] very critical because they don't know what's going on and in 3 years they may feel ashamed about themselves. And we already started the Internet [inaudible] when we started in Japan, when we started the Internet service I have the same [inaudible]. So the Internet was [inaudible] criticism. Well, the Internet is very essential to your life, we can't live without broadband and we can't live without mobile Internet in the future. So there will be that kind of trend coming without doubt. And to provide mobile Internet we made our efforts and as a result, there have been [inaudible] part of people. When I just go out, for instance, I go at Toshiba or maybe I want to go tech shop or I want to [inaudible] I just take out my iPhone and [inaudible] and I just try to get information I want to know. So that's changed my lifestyle. So [inaudible] that is going to be rare and tourist in the paper might will be disappearing from the earth. And [inaudible] may disappear, or comics will be electronic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 electric in the future and also the documents and data for business will be carried on the Internet and that day will be coming. So heading that the lots of paper will be disappearing and the people who are fixed to it will be disappearing too. And why we have to do when that kind of time is coming. So the first thing we have to do is improvement of the network. And here is the strategy of SOFTBANK. And this page is very important. It's actually with own art you can share with idea you would your thinking. In 5 years the volume data in the mobile, it's going to be 40-fold. It's not going to increase by 4 times but in 5 years it's going to increase by 40 times, just in 5 years for now. So if you think, if it's a 4 time figure and you just come with management strategy, or if you think it's going be a 40-fold and you make business, strategy based on the SOFTBANK, it's going to be fundamentally different and it's what we have to think about its CapEx budget is not having money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 indefinite money, ethnic money. So maybe it will be 30 times bigger, or maybe if it's 6 times bigger, but that is just in the range of amount. So roughly, it's going to be around 40 times big size of the volume of data. It's not 4 times bigger. And that is going to affect your management strategy and it's going to change the idea of the network design fundamentally. And in 5 years, the life is going to be increasing by 40 times and 10 years what will happen, 40 times times 40 times. So 1,600 times bigger in 10 years, 40 times, times 40 times. It's not 160 times bigger, but it's going to be 1,600 times. So your forecast is 1,000 times bigger, or it's going to be 10 times bigger in 10 years. And this are depending on the forecast, your management strategy is going to be affected. That is very important to management strategy. And if you agree that the data profit is going to be increasing by 20 times in 5 years, then what will happen to the mobile network? Around the world everywhere, all the operators use [inaudible] and this is use our phone around the world, but we are different one [inaudible] in making the network Microcell and [inaudible] And we will be very quick and we will make our network using Microcell and Femtocell, Why? Because in the previous page [inaudible] which is in 10 years, we are going to have [inaudible] bigger this profit. And 5 years, it's going to be 40 times bigger. But even our LTE or Microcell [inaudible] but if you use Microcell then your network is not going to accommodate the increase of the data traffic demand. So in this page, well, we have been using Microcell. [inaudible] is very special, and okay, this base station can accommodate 500 people, for instance. Then you can just make use of [inaudible] you see how many people can be accommodate from one base station. And if you use Microcell, again, [inaudible] to 3 fold. [inaudible] So for that 5 people, for base station and the base station will be 3. So the traffic volume available for 1 user is going to be tripled. If you use Femtocell, practically, for these 500 people and also lifetime connection to be provided. So there are some top management who just used to say they're not going to do WiFi. And as you know, operating mobile telecom company and maybe I sounds like a little bit speaking up the errors, but I would say it would be a great mistake in the future as you know [inaudible] because that has going to be advantageous to us. But clearly, we are going to take this strategy so that means we are going to use Microcell and also furthermore we are going to [inaudible] network. And okay, the 5 people for instance and [inaudible] on WiFi, it's going to have capability to accommodate 40 times bigger traffic demand. So once again, the previous chart, I talked about, in 5 years the data traffic is going to be increase by 40 times and to accommodate that incremental, we have to provide infrastructure, and we really going to use my Microcell, and Femtocell and WiFi. Our strategy; and of course we have been thinking about it four or five years ago, that we have to be careful about the Chinese; because they shouldn't rush to announce to the height we've been waiting for lifetime and that is today. And there's been various practice in the background. And we are going to use the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we will decide [inaudible] that we talked about IP network is in and also they are [inaudible] our network. And also they talk frankly the personal data who have started the IP network in the world, and we have already acquired for the present. Here I brought it, didn't I? No. I didn't bring it. Sorry about that, but just you look at the photo, this is just a hand side \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the handy side present of sale is ready now. And for your reference, Microcell change to Macrocell, in spite what kind of changes we were able to make in terms of costs and performance. For example, output was twofold, unit price one-fifth, [inaudible] and the weight is one-twentieth, so this volume and weight is also important because, when the time of this civil constructions that its very still different, or if we put it on to the building top, then the cost of the construction, so that we can make it little cheaper and smaller than that, we are able to reduce the burden on the cost or CapEx. So networking infrastructure is something that we need to see the timing and also very important. So as you can see from this picture, it has been much decreased the size in the backbone of the network, the IP network here, what kind of advantage we have on your left-hand side is showing the conventional network design for backbone is non-IP. In the microphones it's also non-IP base station. As you know IP is the Internet Protocol, it stands for [inaudible], so the SoftBank which is an Internet company is trying to make available for the Internet Protocol for complete Internet IP's Internet Protocol network is completely. That's why that we are able to make the higher performance for backbone build in Yahoo! BB, the biggest completely IP network in the world or is made SoftBank in the world. So complete IP network on your right-hand side on the card is the completely LP network. It is connected by the IP access line and is connected to IP. That's why once again that's a 44 or 1,600 times of the network can be absorbed and that we will be able to be ready with that. For the tremendous volume and traffic can be consumed and there will be at the same time, which can be different call by 40 times. So that would be one-fortieth of the cost for the access line of the IP backbone. So we're first in the world making us completely IP network for the mobile communication. The first thing in the world completely IP backbone network, it's going to be ready for mobile phone communications. This one-fortieth of the cost and even that we will have 40 times of logistic, but they continue to remain the same. Here we have 40 times of traffic and if we need to build a same rate of the CapEx, we need to raise the price otherwise we will not be able to sustain than it was. That is why we've been focusing on the complete IP, [inaudible] in here but these are going to be able to provide the synergy with our other services. So now that we are ready to provide such things in that why that we announced if it's going to 2010 network enhancement, I need just and this announcement meant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was made at [inaudible]. So this applying to double a number of mobile phone base station. At the time of Vodafone K.K acquisition, 3G network of the Vodafone was turning 2009 well after the acquisition as I said within one year, we would double the number of base stations and that was a commitment and we did that to 46,000 base stations. And this time a wages number is about 40,000 base stations we have as of the end of March. 50,000 that we've been increasing the number of base station, and now that we're trying to increase by the end of March 2011 once again we would like to doubled the number to 120,000 so this 120,000 excludes home antenna or home [inaudible]. So for the [inaudible] or outdoor coverage, for both total that we are targeting 120,000 of the base stations. And to do so there are the bridge from the [inaudible], which is welcome always the security of the location is important for the base station, especially the mid of bolt-on area. We need to put it on to top of the building or we need to build a tower so the security of the location that we need to extend years and years with so much of the cost. Actually, the decidable works cost more than the high-tech development for the communication companies. So that is why is discussing of [inaudible] locations. And 160,000 related pick-up good areas, good locations, not redundant. We have right now and that will be counted as in candidate of the locations or the sites for the base station, so not redundant in those areas that they remain has to have our own but there are lots of places, which are not so that we will be able to see some benefits from the cost down and fees. Another [inaudible] is 1.5 gigahertz band. We terminated that at the end March and we returned it to the industry. And once again, we would like to use \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we had our license to once again use that for 3G. So replacing from 3G to 3G in same 1.5 gigahertz band and again let us start providing videos for those antennas we will be able to use as it was and only the communication network will be replaced for 3G, so that's why that we will be able to have a low cost in 3G construction. And this is also one of the important strategies of our network. So 1.5 gigahertz, what is the advantage for that? We have two advantage from that one is the coverage area will be wider. I don't like excuses for that I don't say too much but DOCOMO and AU have an 800 megahertz band we don't have it at a license. And this is the handicap that we tried to have and this time we're going to use 1.5 gigahertz which is why at 2 gigahertz, how much is that? I will say about twice of the wider area than the 2 gigahertz. So the reaching point will be twice as much if we were able to have 800 megahertz like KDDI or DOCOMO has. This is a license thing, so even that we wish to have it but we cannot. [inaudible] or MIC decides to provide the license and the 800 megahertz as of today is only provided to DOCOMO and AU. For next licensing timing will be decided next year, so our will is that next year that we would like to have a license from 700 to 900 megahertz. We have three major telecommunication companies and we are the one, the only one that don't have the license for 800 megahertz and we have to have it for next year. But that's something that we need to discuss sometime after this towards next year. But this time we are going to utilize 1.5 gigahertz. Then that we will be able to have twice as much of wider reaching points for the coverage. And you will see 800, that will be four times. So far iPhone had a big difficult connectivity or broadband connectivity. It was not too good. Those kinds of feedback that we have lots and I don't like to make too much excuses. But if we were able to have 800 megahertz, then the same height of the antenna with same measurement, we should have been able to drop out four times of the coverage. As of today neither have it but this time this 1.5 gigahertz that we've able to have twice as much of broader coverage area, which is still for us advantage we will have. Second benefit is the high-speed communication. This time we got TC HSPA for 1.5 gigahertz using this communication speed, including communication capacity will be included, expanded currently it's 7.2 megabit per second, but it will be increased to 42 megabit per second with under the 1.5 gigahertz band. As of today whilst DOCOMO is experimenting NTT communication speed is about 37 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if I maybe correct \\xe2\\x80\\x93 37 megabit per second and at the 5 megahertz band LTE will be around 37 megabit per second. But this time that the TC HSPA that we were going to use, we'd be able to provide 42 megabit per second. So with that speed and the communication capability is going to be the advantage from this 1.5 gigahertz that will be sometime in fourth quarter of this fiscal year. More importantly is the size, smaller size of the cell. So currently those areas have told that [inaudible] coverage area that we would like to provide one-tenth of to households for free. And by having this effective speed will be faster. So those non-coverage areas people will be prioritize to provide the signal to the shops, offices in those areas are now in the coverage that that we would like to also provide mobilizations for free. And so those shops and offices we would like to provide WiFi routers for free with that data speed and capacity will be much better and the second will be free of charge. And we are planning to introduce these at various shops, caf\\xc3\\xa9s, shops, large restaurants, so these start-up system applications from May 5 under the Softbank networking has made an initiative. So shops and outdoor decisions, we will try to double the number. That is the first thing. And the second point is the Acrobat in Femtos and free of charge to homes. And third is the WiFi \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, just mobile stations to shops and offices. And fourth is the WiFi to shops and offices. So in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the 1.5 gigahertz with the same height of the antenna that we'll be able to double the size of the coverage. So, far now those shops without Wi-Fi is equals to shops without the air-conditions, you don't want to go into going to those shops without the air-conditioning. So, I believe that the people who see the same that those shops without Wi-Fi that people want to go in. So, smaller sales becomes key and we would like to work on that strategically. So, four years, five years continues that the data traffic to be 1,600 times and [inaudible] best strategy and the business plans, and that is the base for our network planning and at the same time to increase the satisfaction of the customers. And the next is the equipment devices, we have iPhone and the smartphone is coming into the market one after another 2011 though the 50% of people addressed on in United States. In four, five years from now, [inaudible] smartphone users are involved accounted being 1.3 billion. There is first be a market sense and iPhone is selling around, and that is actually number one in the sale and that is over one in number one among all of the models. You can see the actual numbers iPhone sales is increasing. The second were selling one in 820P of SoftBank. And W-160A of 33i is the second, the third best selling one, we can see from this chart after the 13 months probably \\xe2\\x80\\x93 usually you see model sales going down that hasn't alone in the iPhone alone it's the key for the sales increase. And here is Android compact, is that right \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is right to say, is it going to meeting the sales is 27, right, okay so it's to-date? Our Android mobile, naturally be, while there are other models of Android by NTT DOCOMO and android is 25. Our OS is different from others, there are Android 1.6 version of Andriod 2.1 version and what is the difference? Well I can say all of the model we did find. So, the functions are upgraded under the thinnest and is lightest. There are some lightest and its right to most shift the since the OS is the latest version. We are the technology company, we are mobile embedded company and is our time. In the new stock performance in Matsushita more than 10 mobiles would be used by household in the future, when they were about they were hardly in month or two in times of transport. And now it's not just saying that maybe 20 or 30 mobile are household, I think my house has more than 100 mobile. So, that we Vienna and I will state that there will be a time when one family is more than 10 mobile internet [inaudible]. From there we actually have take around the corner that is my forecast and asset of the future. All kinds [inaudible] will have a communication function using the [inaudible] computer processor, so that means the artificial intelligence is going to embedded in it. So, resulting from [inaudible] so in that point of time we will be coming to that vibe and that requires mobile internet. So, four of the basic asset is going to increase WiFi. You cannot say the number of the people is the [inaudible] line to the hold. It is the results and the sales and the signs of low isn't going to be changed. As we think we have become mobile internet provider. And here is the digital footprint with telecommunication functionality, and it's a one touch, it's good enough to stand out the circles through this telecommunication functionality. And we're first one in selling the bigger dream in the route. That is the top five selling given for you, and b.i.d. that is for the telecommunication functionality in the route. Now, personal computer will go on to increase in the first capability so it was about the efficiency excel, word as you know. And the relative mobile internet is too sharp really it's an excitement. This slide today now people are using these tools and if they are watching this announcement on a real-time basis and mainly who are [inaudible] they are integrated and they are clear. [inaudible]. That's when I was expecting. So, maybe [inaudible] from now and if I'm asking the same question, what will \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will there be multiple who are raising their hand. And the [inaudible] people they will be using which I think. And people who go asking now that in [inaudible] was not listed. But I just asked you a question. How many people are [inaudible] and if he uses timely device and this kind of function then we will have a higher efficiency in our life. It's not just about [inaudible] but it's about interrupted sharing of on internet sharing others. That kind of pushing network is coming. It's not just limited to bluetooth, but that kind of functions will ensure no risks and risks on unemployment and that is going to be when we refer, when we can say we call it, sharing videos. So, I'm talking about [inaudible]. The number of the interest of ustream or the viewers of ustream will support although 100 million. So, it's almost same with the whole population of Japan. And this is a monthly figure, but assume zeros. It's increase by 16 million, a great number. And a time to, or the sports love. We already we know that is progression of TV, actually number of TV stations in the world is 28,000. Which are available for the live portion in the world along the world. We took a number of TV station in the 28,000, because that is still in progression, you can just optimize the WorldCom video and number of their people using their Smartphone is 300 million. And for that reason they have offering new [inaudible]. And in last month \\xe2\\x80\\x93 last year in the Headquarter, we are going to differ studio, first is configure. And the second is going to be opened on the 3rd of May, and the third is going to be opened at Kodax, karoke zone. And today it is Japanese [inaudible]. And last month actually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we actually don't has a tutor and is a vaccine, it will be [inaudible]. So, the clients can share the excitement. And use it as long, using the MySpace and they can share their views and excitement. It actually classified this first, it's offering the business model. It actually means value exchange bullet of customer. So, the TV resolution has been increased with that above and also ASP does the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it has also increased. Listing directors to come wait of customers, [inaudible]. So, that kind of additional check has bought it. So, from the voice of the customers, we have created new tools and share many of them. And there is also a number which we along the [inaudible] is over 1.6 billion. And 94 simultaneously already welcome, so it's about pricing treat that is 1.6 billion amounting so the world is so fast and claim that to a graph. While in January, [inaudible]. And savings like you said, you had numbers of 100 million, so that many users are using Tweeter on PC. So, it's a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you ask this people who are using this Tweeter as number of phone, using this application then it [inaudible] 180 million. So, it's going to be about 200 million, official number of viewers. So, that is the best official number and that is the clearance to the fifth biggest population in our country. And three elements to going in mobile internet, network, devices and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all of them has to be incorporated in 5 digits. And amount all of the mobile operators in the [inaudible]. Among all of the other operators mobile, in the route, SoftBank alone has actually created design of the network to accommodate [inaudible] data traffic incentive. And also the most aggressive operators to the proacted in this deal and soft side is the share who is doing the [inaudible]. Operating income 455.8 billion and the mix, this CapEx of 100 billion and net interest being debt reduction has remained unchanged and please don't forget internet. Thank you very much for your attention.\",\n",
       " '2010 Q1': \"My name is Son from SoftBank. Thank you very much for coming today. For today's earnings results announcement, there are good news and good for me, was the previous annual general meeting of shareholders and also we had a meeting to present the next 30-year vision of SoftBank Group. With those meetings, we are able to become one amongst directors, officers and employees to aim for this target. And it became more clear, especially for myself, after we present this vision. It became more clear where we are heading towards, how we are going to achieve that, and how we are going to do that. And this was a very great opportunity for us to think about that. And after this presentation, there are several ideas and opportunities came and is coming to the company, and I'm feeling that very much. Of course, it was told that this was the big mount of mind and that this was the big amount of our next 30-year vision. But we would like to do our best to achieve how far we can be closer to this target. But having this clear target or having this clear vision, it is more important for us to run this business not only for myself but also for the employees. And the other day at night \\xe2\\x80\\x93 yesterday, as a matter of fact, we had our first conference of those who are going to join for SoftBank Academia. And I had a lecture and it was full of passions, and I was very much surprised and happy to see so many passionate young generations and employees in SoftBank. And I was very happy to see those people. And there are so many people with tens of thousands of people are also willing to join the SoftBank Academia, external from outside of this company. And there are several comments and tweets and tweeters which makes me very happy. And I am going to present the results of the first quarter in detail now, but I believe this is still the first step towards the big target. Of course, the content or the results is very good, but I believe that we will have more and more growth in the future. First of all, this is the highlight. As you can see, our net sales increased 5% and also operating income increased 45%. Especially in Mobile business, customer numbers and the ARPU increased dramatically. On page 4 shows the breakdown. As you can tell, in each category, making a good growth. And I'll make some comments on net income later on. Page 5 shows the competitors' comparison. As a matter of fact, today, on 3 o'clock, DoCoMo also announced their earnings result. KDDI already made their announcement, so this is the comparison chart. Page 6, this is also again a comparison of the operating income and as you can tell we are making quite a good progress in operating income. Page 7, maybe it's too much to have this much of the comparison with competitors, but we're making first record on better operating income than KDDI. I am very happy about that, that's why that I made this graph. Ordinary income also made a better figure than the competitors. As a matter of fact, and also on net sales on page 8, EBITDA page 9, again the record high increased by 23%, consolidated EBITDA on page 10, again the record high for 7 consecutive periods. Page 11, comparison of the operating income, compared to year-on-year, we have increased by 45% especially the mobile business are showing quite a good growth here. And record high for 5 consecutive periods on page 12. Ordinary income increased by 61%. As you can see, the growth ratio as a matter of fact accelerated. Page 14 is the details of ordinary income and the net income. On page 15, consolidated net income is doing smoothly however at this time we have received the correction and ruling notice from Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau. And we have sold SOFTBANK ITDC Solutions to Yahoo Japan and this was of course not only for the tax purpose but this has been instructed from tax office that this was for the tax reason. Of course this is not something that we could do for the tax reason but because we have received the correction notice. So we first have this \\xc2\\xa524.7 billion in here. In page 16, 3% especially for those IT-related companies Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo! or Alibaba, or Apple, of course, owning quite a large datacenter for their core business and they are constructing one after another. Yahoo! Japan in Japan to focus on the cloud computer from now on. It is natural for them, Yahoo! Japan, to acquire datacenter and enhance this business. This cannot be happening only for the taxation purpose, and I believe that this is outside of common sense of IT companies or industries. So, I would like to point that out once again, in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I believe Yahoo! Japan will file a suit for against this purpose because IT companies are competing each other in the world. I don't know why this kind of excuse came out from this tax regional bureau. And I believe that their mind is behind the time and I would like to clarify that once again. So here, we have a net income provision about the \\xc2\\xa540 billion or so, but we believe that this will come back to us. Acquisition of iDC Solutions by Yahoo! Japan, this was not because of the taxation purpose but they are a definite business necessity including the cloud deployment service enhancement and significant cost reduction. In page 19, operating cash flow, as you can see in page 20, this the tax at the Yahoo! Japan about \\xc2\\xa546.4 billion and we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our expectation is that this will come back to us. But for the accounting purpose that we have this column here. And because tax SOFTBANK Mobile is making a profit, so tax at SOFTBANK Mobile is about \\xc2\\xa549.6 billion. So substantial results, including net income is increasing. Page 21 shows the consolidated CapEx. This year we made announcement on the SOFTBANK network enhancement initiatives. In a try to expand the coverage, at the same time enhance the capacity and that is the offshore announcement that we made. And we are working on very hard including securing site and purchasing the equipments. Page 22 shows the consolidated free cash flow. Again, we have a tax issue at Yahoo! Japan. Page 24 shows the net interest bearing debt. Comparison to peak level and we have reduced cost to \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. Page 25, in next fiscal year we expecting to have the net interest bearing in compared to the level of fiscal year '08. And by fiscal year '14, that we would like to bring this down to zero. So we, our commitment to reduce net interest bearing debt remains unchanged even as we increase the CapEx. Page 26: to achieve this commitment today we have announced that we are going to issue the stock acquisition rights, which is the stock options with charge for those 300 to 400 directors, corporate officers and employees. It's about 0.37%; however, the same amount of shares will be repurchased, so from the shareholders' point of view there will be no dilution because of this treasury stock buyback. So expecting about 300 to 400 executives and employees that we are going to issue, but this is only available when achieving the three conditions below. So this right will be exercisable only when those three conditions are achieved. The first condition is to have at least \\xc2\\xa51 trillion free cash flow in 3 years and have the net interest bearing debt by the end of next fiscal year compared to the level of fiscal year '08. And amount aggregated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 amount of operating income of at least \\xc2\\xa51.1 trillion for 2010 and 2011. So those three conditions has to be achieved or our stock options cannot be exercised. And at the same time there will be no dilution to treasury stock repurchase. Therefore the commitment that we made will be definitely achieved. So there are lots of public announcement and commitment here and there but we are the one that are going to achieve these commitments so we have to make it clear that. On page 28 is the net subscribers additions. Compared to first quarter of last fiscal year we have doubled the number. Page 29, net additions comparison with competitors. Page 30, the mobile number portability, having a 3.5 fold, those two competitors are showing decrease in porting but we're making 2.5 fold year-on-year on porting number. And our churn rate, last time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 last announcement that we made, there are some questions about increasing of churn rate from now on. But as I mentioned that time, that we are going to set all this down. In the first quarter we are able to bring this down to 1.02%. So this is what I would like to announce today. ARPU, you see the competitor's result, which was announced today and the other day. As for SOFTBANK compared to last year plus 260, last year Q4 it went down. This includes some seasonal factors. But Q1 it went up again. The factors for the increase of the ARPU, the major factors are the data ARPU increase that is what I would like to report today. Page 34, earlier I said the company-wide operating income increased by 45%. Particularly mobile communications segment compared to the previous year increased by 70%. So this is the first time that it went above \\xc2\\xa5100 billion. One of the factors is iPad. iPad is receiving many inquiries from major corporations and the pilot introduction has started. The one example is Otsuka Pharmaceutical. Otsuka Pharmaceutical would like to utilize iPad. MizuhoBank would like to use iPad to explain products at the teller \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the counter. So going forward, instead of the paper catalogue, which was used at the life and non-life insurance or the real estate or the car dealers, they used to use the paper catalogue in the past. For those segments and industry going forward, maybe in several years, instead of the paper they will use electronic device like iPad. So many companies have announced the introduction of iPad and these names \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just example, the other day we held the iPad explanation to major companies, and more than 3,000 people gathered. And they listened to us and they said that they would like to introduce that in their work. Of course iPad is not only for e-book, but in the area of e-book the market is expanding. So going forward with the emergence of the iPad, we think that the e-book market will further expand. One example is here. We started something called Dew as a group company, there are many magazines, for example a female magazine called CanCan and the CanCan page is there. If you turn the page you will see the CanCan pages. So the magazine pages, with a click you can see these pages or the newspaper, TV news can be seen with this view, with the terminal. 31 media outlets, which is equivalent to \\xc2\\xa540,000, with iPad only the \\xc2\\xa5450 per month. Then the users can see about 40,000 magazines. So all these famous magazines are included and furthermore, starting June, iPhone 4 was sold worldwide. The reservation of the iPhone 4 was much more than what we expected instantaneously. And we are sorry that the many customers have to wait for the iPhone 4. The interest and the number of the reservation was more than what we expected and even now we have a backlog. We are shipping every day, but then we get new orders. So that is the current situation. So it's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are very happy, but for this customers who are waiting, I have to say sorry. Should I buy iPad or iPhone? I get this question from the Twitters. I said, samurai would use two swords; that means big sword and small sword. And having two swords, then we get a real samurai because the big sword has its own law and small sword has its own law. I myself is using iPhone and iPad both, and even today I have iPhone and iPad on this table. I cannot live without them. I always carry them. iPad WiFi model and the 3G model, which one should I use, I get this kind of the question. Well sure, I say, 3G model; 3G, WiFi both. I mean, it has to be anytime and anywhere. Anytime and anywhere, but if the iPad can be used only in the area where it's WiFi, that's frustrating and people will regret \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I strongly feel that after I started to use it. You really understand the advantage of them once you have both iPad and iPhone. In addition to iPhone and iPad, there's Android phone, and there are many kind of the Smartphone. And the data traffic will increase for the next 5 years the data traffic will increase by about 40 times. This graph was prepared by Cisco. So Cisco's forecast is at the 40-fold increase, which is exactly same as SoftBank's forecast. So the base stations, we have to increase the area where the radio wave can reach and we also have to increase the capacities as well. So we announced a plan to double the number of the mobile phone base station by March next year. As of March this year, we have about 60,000. In one year we will double that. On a global level, none of the communications carriers have done that to increase the base \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to double the number of the base station in one year. 1.5 gigahertz, starting the service we will do the full scale servicing and 2 gigahertz, the current 2 gigahertz. The site was finalized, 190,000. So the total 940,000 sites where identified and the design has been going on. And placing an order for equipment to have 120,000 base station is going on, so the work is in line with the schedule and furthermore the home use Femtocells already 30,000 applications that we received. The number of the post, we have to get an approval from the number of the home affairs for each and individual applications. But the opening has started for those customers where it's open we receive thank you message that their life has very comfortable. And WiFi spot, we want to increase that. Starbucks, for almost all of the Starbucks shops our WiFi has been connected and MINISTOP as well. And Motosumi/Bremen shopping street, the entire shopping street WiFi can be used. This is another example. So as a result page 51, all of these brands agreed to install SoftBank WiFi spots. So going for the engineering work and the opening of the station will take place. These are the brands who have already agreed to install the SoftBank WiFi spots. In March this year, compared to March this year, the number of the brands who agreed were 16. This is McDonald's, and others. Only 16 I should say. Then the end of March 2011 the number will be 774 brands who would agree to install SoftBank WiFi spots. So in the past only 3G network was the one, the only one that received the data traffic, but going forward in addition to 3G network we have a Femtocell and WiFi. It will shift from 3G network to Femtocell and WiFi. Now 1.5 gigahertz starting September our full-fledged service will start and the 700 megahertz and the 900 megahertz is in the process of obtaining an approval and within the next several months the policy will be fixed. And the next fiscal year the allocations will be decided and from 2012 this will become available. According to the current schedule as for NTT, DOCOMO and AU, 800 megahertz \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they obtained this 800 megahertz. As for SoftBank, as of today, we only have a 2 gigahertz band. They have both \\xe2\\x80\\x93 either both 2 gigahertz and 800 or 801.5. We would like to go into this new band such as a 900 or a 700 because we want to have equal opportunity; it should be our time to get this. So we would like to increase the number of the base stations and Wi-Fi, Femtocell and new bandwidth. So the data capacity increase and area enhancement will take place, and starting this month, probably, we are the first one among the world mobile provider that will launch a new service called Unlimited Packet Discount for Overseas, starting from this morning. I spoke with overseas people and I talked about this and they were all surprised. In U.S. and Europe they have never heard of this and they said they would like to move to Japan to get this service. So in the past, when you make a overseas business trip, and just stayed there for several days, and use iPhone, Smartphone, and only for several days, they ended up spending \\xc2\\xa5100,000 or \\xc2\\xa5200,000, just for the data costs. And quite a few businesspersons experienced that. And only \\xc2\\xa51,480 per day is something unexpected price and it's something that you can feel safe to use it and I believe that the SoftBank is the first company in the world to implement such service. And at the same time it is available in 31 countries and regions. These 31 countries and region is that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is a major \\xe2\\x80\\x93 includes the major countries and regions where the Japanese businessman goes for the business trips or Japanese people making trips. And I believe that about 80% of the major sites for the business trip and travel has been covered so that the people there want to feel safe to use the Packet service. Page 58 renewed, let's do it first. After I started Twitter, I have been receiving so much voices from customers, improvement requests and for those voices I myself making some commitments like, for example, for some Tweeters that I will say let's do it and right we have about 14 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 66 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and at the same time, that the 49 out of those list has been achieved so far. So those 49 items has been already improved or solved, that issues that I have received from customers. So, with this Twitter I have been making communication with customers. So not only let's do it but also I am reporting completed of those items that has been requested. And the presentation next 30-year vision that I have announced, that I am going to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are going to build a strategic synergy group, and right now we have about 800 but we would like to make it 5,000 within 30 years. And one of the example is that, we have Yahoo! Japan, Taobao, and the Alibaba group. This is something that we aiming for the strategic synergy. So between the group companies of SoftBank that we are trying to ally and also, making our synergy. And this is one of the good example. So Taobao itself, well it's only providing B2B service but after then that they are making \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there was the Alibaba, but after then that Alibaba and SoftBank created a joint venture to do the C2C or B2C. So the Taobao itself is already the synergy generations made by SoftBank and Alibaba. In the online shopping transaction, value as of last year already made \\xc2\\xa53.8 trillion. This has already exceeding the figure of Amazon in U.S. So, it's becoming the biggest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the biggest. So, not Amazon only in U.S., but Amazon worldwide figure already we have exceeded. And one another example is the USTREAM. Today also, we are having a live broadcast of USTREAM service. And also, having co-relations with the Twitter. And we have established \\xe2\\x80\\x93 announced establishment of USTREAM Asia on May 18, 2010. So SoftBank already is the major shareholder of USTREAM U.S. and together with this USTREAM we have built a joint venture of USTREAM Asia with 6% versus 32%. USTREAM service is making dramatic growth, as of June this year monthly active viewers number exceeded 160 million. 160 million, so it had made about 60% of growth in the previous reported USTREAM made, which was about 100 million or so. One another thing is that we made announcement today. Zynga: this is the world's largest social game development and the number of monthly active users already recording 230 million. So this is a unique active user numbers already exceeding 230 million. And these are the examples of what it looks it. So this is the latest, one of the latest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 FrontierVille, so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x93 game, and this is making rapid growth in the market and you yourself, for example, is going to develop as a Frontier in the farm. And the friend may visit you and the friend can do the work at the field instead, on behalf of you or feed cows and you will be able to see what your friend did for you. So the friend's ghost can playback it for you, so you know that what friend did for you, so the point will be given to your friend and also to yourself. So in the return you can go to friend's farm and do some help. So there is a lot of happy thinking game. And this is making rapid growth. So social game is something that you can play with your friends on SNS and in principal free of charge, but at the same time you can buy the items, for example the new seeds for the farm or for the feedings for your cows. So these item sales is becoming a big source of revenue. So the world's largest SNS site, as you know, the Facebook is. Facebook, for example in U.S., the market share of visits in U.S. is almost exceeding \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or already has exceeded the market share of Google. And in this Facebook and when you see the Facebook application ranking, 6 or 7 out of 10 applications are from Zynga and these are the numbers of active users. FrontierVille is already coming to about second ranking, so it's making quite great growth. There are about 500,000 or so of the applications in the Facebook, of which most of the games for the top ten are coming from Zynga. So this is a great thing. And I believe out of all the traffic of Facebook, about close to 40% of the traffic is coming from Zynga. So this is the great company. And it's becoming overwhelming number one position in social game. And the number of monthly active users, I mentioned earlier 230 million for Zynga. And when you see the overall online game in U.S. it's about 90 million or so. Against that the active users number in Zynga is already at 230 million. And here the Zynga and SoftBank announced to establish a joint venture. So SoftBank is going to invest in Zynga in U.S. of JPY13.7 billion, and the 50% investment from SoftBank in Zynga to establish Zynga Japan. Today we have Vice President of Zynga, key man from Zynga in U.S., that we have Mr. Robert Goldberg is here with us, and now let's introduce him. This will be the key players for iPhone, iPad and will be the biggest and the strongest applications for mobiles and terminals. And I would like to have this to contribute to increase the ARPU and also increase the value of corporate and at the same time that we will have a great success in Zynga. Mr. Robert Goldberg, Please join us. [Translator] Please use your receivers for the interpretation. Thank you. <A - Robert Goldberg>: Son san, Thank you so much for such a kind introduction. I can't tell you how thrill I'm to here on such an important day for Zynga. But our journey here actually goes back maybe 10 years, to when you first invested in our CEO's first company, Freeloader, and when you and I invested in other companies. But the journey, the current journey started about three and half years ago for Zynga. As you've said, we've experienced very rapid growth in that time, and we been fortunate in that. And we're now at the precipice of being able to deliver games globally, and that's really where our quest begins, our motto and our goal is to connect the world through games, and we set our sights now on rapid international expansion. No market for us could be more important than the Japanese market. The Japanese market represents global and leading edge mobile and consumer services. We're very privilege to be here with SoftBank and to be here with you as you have delivered visionary services to consumers across Japan. And we look forward to delivering our games to the Japanese market and to learning very much from doing so. Thank you very much. Mr. Goldberg, thank you very much and thank you very much everyone. Now I'd like to go back to the presentation. And another thing we would like to announce is regarding JIL. This is amongst SoftBank, China Mobile, Vodafone and Verizon, so it's those four parties that we have an alliance to build the business for mobile phone and develop the technology. This is the joint ventures for those four companies and JIL. We're going to have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 currently that we have 1 billion users that we are going to join in WAC to build the new consortium. So WAC member would be about 3 billion mobile users we'll manage. So these 3 billion users, new services will be developed by all the major mobile providers. And I believe that announcement in U.S. and Europe is taking place around today. SoftBank, China Mobile and Vodafone were major members at the WAC and they were the board members, and we would like to active lead WAC. These are the board members at the WAC. And finally, I mentioned at the beginning that we announced our 30-Year Vision. Some of you might have seen it; I would like to show you about two minutes after of the making of the video. [Video Presentation] In 2010, heated discussion of our next 30 year vision. See our meeting of SoftBank in June from 2010 for next 30 year vision discussion. Japan is losing its energy, we need to revitalize this, SoftBank business should continue to develop an Asian economy. Last we can make it so we can make a relationship, integration on [inaudible] we made. If I don't do it, who will do it. Without passion, we cannot go forward. What are we waiting for? How can we contribute to the society, how to make people smile? June 10, 2010 final presentation for next 30-year visions. This is the summer lineup from SoftBank Mobile: we should aim for the world number one robot company, I am presenting the way of human raising, should realize the dream we have through space and time, relieved from the stress by having a time to get happiness. The SoftBank in 30 years will be the corporate group, which will continue to the world happiness. Aim to become Africa's number one internet company. People's vision become one vision. We are putting our effort for information revolutions but this is not because of our ego or anything like that. All our presentation have a common passion; passion to continue to the people, that made me so happy. There are many companies throughout the world, 20,000 people, all of our employees got together to think about a 30-year vision of their company, and we had a big presentation meeting and this was a competition for all of the employee to create a 30-year vision. I believe that we are the only company in the world to do that. So all of the employees seriously have thought about their company's 30 years from now. So this process itself means that the employees are united and also employees are committed. So I am really proud of my employees. I talked about the SoftBank Academia opening ceremony last night. for the purpose of the SoftBank Academia \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have only one purpose, to train successors. The other companies are conducting management training. Of course SoftBank has a general training and management training, but the purpose of the SoftBank Academia is only purpose, is to identify my successors and to train my successor. So SoftBank Academia has only one purpose. And yesterday the Academia had opening ceremony. So make people happy through information revolution, that is the vision. This concludes my presentation. Thank you very much. I would like to use the rest of the time for Q&A. \",\n",
       " '2010 Q2': \"Good afternoon, everyone. I am Son from SoftBank. For today's earnings results announcement, in one word, we are doing very good. And I cannot finish my presentation with that word, so I would like to go into the details. This is the highlight. And operating income exceeds \\xc2\\xa5300 billion, record high for five consecutive periods. And we've been having a very smooth operation in Mobile Communications business. And this is the summary for consolidated earnings results. Net sales, EBTIDA, operating income, ordinary income, net income \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in all figures. We have exceeded the previous term's numbers. And this is in comparison with the competitors. Revenue and profit increased in SoftBank, so we are doing quite a good operation. And this is the comparisons for the operating income. And net sales \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is the breakdown of our net sales; EBITDA showing record high and also hitting the record high for seven consecutive periods. And the page 10 shows the breakdown of operating income. We have 37% increase, with \\xc2\\xa5315.5 billion, and operating income hitting a record high for five consecutive periods. Ordinary income, also hitting the record high for five consecutive periods with 46% increase, \\xc2\\xa5253.8 billion. And this page shows the breakdown of net income. A 9% increase in net income in this term due to the impact of correction and ruling notice received by Yahoo! Japan. We had an impact of \\xc2\\xa524.7 billion. Even excluding that part, still we were able to record the 9% increase. And financial status \\xe2\\x80\\x93 operating cash flow, also showing good performance with 11% increase. As mentioned earlier, there are some impact of correction and ruling notice received by Yahoo! Japan. CapEx, \\xc2\\xa5400 billion, which is the original figures that we announced, and that's also as scheduled in the free cash flow of 24% increase. And this again have impact on correction and ruling notice received by Yahoo! Japan. Net interest-bearing debt \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have reduced by \\xc2\\xa5930 billion. Just four years ago, when we had acquired Vodafone K.K., \\xc2\\xa52.4 trillion was the highest net interest-bearing debt, but we've been able to reduce smoothly. And at the time of acquisition, we had payment commitment with financial institutions. And these gray bars are the schedules for the repayment. And now as a matter of fact, we've been accelerating the repayment pace. So by the end of next fiscal year, we are going to have the net interest-bearing debt, which at the peak time was \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion at Lehman shock period. But \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and also by the end of fiscal year '14 that we are going to pay down the debt. As a result, just about two years ago, we had a Lehman shock, and our company was told or there was a rumor that our company will be bankrupt. And with that rumor that we had quite a high bond spread, however that has been settled down, and the coupon rate is now 1.24%. Mobile Communications business; net additions, 2.3-fold, year-on-year basis. Especially, the monthly basis net addition showing threefold year-on-year for September. And this is in comparison with competitors. Net additions in the competitors include quite a large portion other than mobile handset, but we have been able to increase the good numbers in net additions from the mobile users. Churn ratio has been improved down to 0.96%. In the TV commercial preference ranking, we're happy that we were able to achieve the Triple Crown, by production, by brand and by company. So there was about 4,411 productions in the month, and we were able to rank in first and also first ranking in by brand and by company category. And the TV commercial has also came from Twitter. With Ms. Ayumi Hamasaki, we were able to cooperate with her to generate the TV commercials, which is also very popular. And we have just created a new TV commercial, which will be started on \\xe2\\x80\\x93 starting from the day after tomorrow. So today, I would like to show you before we actually put it on the TV. And this is quite interesting, so I want to share with you. [Advertisement] We used to have Cameron Diaz in early days for Pantone TV commercial with a variety of colors, which was also very popular, but then \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and this time we are going to launch Pantone 3. This Pantone 3 is now featuring the Father dog of Shirato-family so the standby displays, straps, ringing tones, all are now featuring Father dog of Shirato-family or White Family. And they will be on TV from the day after tomorrow. iPhone and iPad is also another popular character in all the products in SoftBank, but the Father Dog is also another popular characters in SoftBank, so we would like to cherish that. And there are several initiatives in content. We were able to turnaround the ARPU year-on-year basis. And worldwide, I believe, almost of the all operators, mobile operators, are showing decline in ARPU and are not much of the companies are showing the increase or turnaround in ARPU, but the SoftBank is making increase in ARPU. And the main reason is coming from data ARPU, which is showing quite a good performance. With this data ARPU support that we've been able to turnaround the ARPU itself and actually keep contributing to our revenue and profit. So, number of customers increasing at the same time increasing ARPU. So those two factors are the main contribution to the revenue and profit. As a result, we have, as you can see on the page 36, right before the acquisition, Vodafone K.K. was experiencing the operating income decline. It was huge declines year-after-year in terms of operating income. So only looking at the red part on your left hand side, one year after then that is not hard to imagine that what happened to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what would happen to the operating income for Vodafone K.K. So that was about the time and we spent \\xc2\\xa52 trillion to buy this operator, which was a very bold action, even that when I think about that now, but still could be very expensive shopping that we did. But at a time who imagined or who forecasted that this operating income could turnaround. But then most of the analysts or most of the media people, analysts, those who are specialist looking at this situation expect that the operating income will fall. And at the same time, at the time of acquisition, it was expected to help our number portability coming six months later, so that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we were told that SoftBank will be totally the loser of the game. But compared \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and to avoid the situation that we would need to spend a lot of sales promotions and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but still was expected to have a fall in our incomes and revenues. So that's why we had some declines in the share price of SoftBank right after the acquisition of Vodafone K.K. That decline was about 60%, so most of the investors were also worried about the situation. But you see these results on this page, the grey bars is right after the SoftBank. The brand became the SoftBank, the operating income is improved. So only this one page makes me a little bit of a shocking, but at the same time that we were able to overcome the big challenge. But at the same time, still we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 still some challenges ahead and the weak point, which is the coverage issue. And the level of the coverage is not yet satisfying myself, so I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have to improve this situation. So that's why that we have announced in March that we are going to double the number of base stations. And this is the main theme of the management meeting of SoftBank. And though the members of management meeting is checking the progress of this base number of base stations and the improvement of the coverage, so this is the biggest focus of ours right now. And we've been securing the site for the base stations and also securing the equipments, resources for the civil works. And by the end of March, we would like to bring this number of base stations to 120,000. At this moment, progress is as scheduled so far. On our website, we have the numbers disclosed to customers. How many more base stations do we need to build? In the Femtocell, also receiving application from customers, which exceeded 50,000 right now. In the installations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after the installation, more than 92% customers have told us that the situation has been improved and that they are satisfied with the situation. Furthermore, about the rehabilitations of WILLCOM next month rehabilitation plan, decisions on the rehabilitation plan will be made. On our end, to rehabilitate WILLCOM has many meanings to us. One is, 4 million customers that they have, we have to avoid any of the confusions generated to the customers and subscribers. That will be very important as well as good thing not just for the subscribers, but to the industry as a whole. But another perspective is from the business perspective \\xe2\\x80\\x93 business operation perspective of SoftBank. Now, we talked about the coverage improvement plan. We would like to increase the numbers of the base stations. The bottleneck of increasing the numbers of the base station is to secure the locations available to build the base station. Now when we are to secure the land, the land that WILLCOM possess, will be instrumental for us to build our base stations. So that is a big contribution that we expect from the WILLCOM side. So when we are to build the base station, securing the site, as well as there are capable engineers at WILLCOM. They are the ones and who have actually built the wireless and cell stations. The largest numbers has been built by these engineers, so they do have a lot of know-hows. They are really talented people. We would like to leverage on their capability and proving to be very beneficial when we are to build our base station. Now, there is about 4 million customers to WILLCOM. If there was a dramatic reductions in to the numbers of the customers that will hurt the business, but we would like to improve the situation as much as possible. And I think we have a better prospect of doing that. At the time of the acquisitions of the Vodafone, their profit level has been coming down considerably. However, we could essentially save them, rescue them. So we believe that we will be able to do the same with WILLCOM. That is the challenge that we would like to do moving forward. Now here you see the summary of the first half. Revenue and profit increase to reach record high. And net adds, we enjoy the overwhelming number one. And also, the ARPU positive turnarounds. So these are the three highlights for the mobile business and for the first half of this fiscal year. Now I'm sure that you all have the common question. What is that common question? Will SoftBank \\xe2\\x80\\x93 yes, it seems to be performing fairly good recently. However, this good business, good performance can be sustained. Will SoftBank keep winning? I'm sure that this is the common question that all of you have and our response is, let's do it. This comes from the Twitter that I personally write once in a while. So this shows my determination, let's do it. We work hard towards that end. So \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but we are going to work on, or we work towards number one Mobile Internet company. So this is something that we would like to materialize. Now, here please look at the equation towards victory, X+X equals X. What does this mean? You may think as such. X+X equals X. Let me explain what this means. The first X stand for smartphone versus conventional terminal. Blue line shows smartphone. The sales ratio of the conventional terminal will come down considerably. On the other hand, the blue will be growing, the smartphone sales will increase. And the next, the personal computers, would be declining. On the other hand, smartpad will be one that will be increasing. The third X is competitors losing or decreasing, SoftBank increasing. Very simple equations towards victory. This is something that we would like to materialize. I'll now need to explain each element. First of all, smartphone versus conventional terminal. At the time of launch of iPhone in 2008, we talked about the Mobile Internet. We said that we are now at the start of the Mobile Internet era. The most \\xe2\\x80\\x93 major product in the mobile phone era is the iPhone. That's what we had mentioned. Many critics, analysts said that no way iPhone can be sold in the Japanese market. They seem to be pretty confident in making that statement, and their comment seems to be the majority of the press people. In other words, iPhone without having the settlement functions or without the one segment or without the character fonts. In other words, there is highly sophisticated mobile phone culture in Japan and iPhone does not meets up to that quality level. That was what many people were saying on iPhone. But what was the result? iPhone, hot selling, recording a steady growth. Overwhelmingly iPhone has gained the number one position in smartphone. And this is not a temporary boom. The point here is that it is steadily growing and the pace is accelerating. Once you experience iPhone, you can never go back to conventional handset terminal. And there maybe some copycat of iPhones. However, they look as though they are similar, however they are actually not. Once you use it, once you have experienced it, you can never forget about that. It just sinks into your body, you can not let it go. This shows the market share in the Japanese domestic market. iPhone accounts for 80% of the overall market in the smartphone segment; overwhelmingly number one. There are very similar handset terminals, but iPhone versus BlackBerry was what people were talking about two years ago. And some press were saying that the chance is 50:50. But what's the result? There is only very limited numbers of the BlackBerry users here in the Japanese market. The iPhone's victory is overwhelming. Within the smartphone segment, iPhone continues its steady growth in sales. This is not merely the temporary boom or just the terminal for the maniac people. And this is one indictor of the ratio of the female users of the new subscribers are the breakdown between the male and female. The female users are increasing fairly rapidly. Male users, they are early adapters when there are new devices and they are the ones who firstly adopt. The speed, the size of the screen or CPU level or battery life; these quantitative indicators are important for the male users. However, these are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 maybe the characteristics are only very sophisticate to manic type of users. The fact that we are seeing increasing numbers of the female users tells us that people are not just focusing on the specification of the iPhone. However, iPhone has now established itself as a culture. In other words, people just love iPhone. People evaluate iPhone fairly highly. So, gender ratio has come close to very even ratio. I'm very glad to see that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I'm not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the point here is not about the gender ratio. However, initially the male accounted for about 80 or 90% of the total users. I'm now happy to see the increase of the female users. So iPhone has become very popular and this is one proof of that. Now, next is about the Corporate segment. iPhone is increasing its pace in the Corporate segment as well. Compared to two years ago or two and a half years ago, the increase is as much as 40-fold. In the Corporate segment, we see a very high level of growth of the sales. All our employees are the users of iPhone. Our expense level is coming down. Overtime, expense is coming down. The paper related expenses are going down. Efficiency level is going up considerably. iPhone is so useful to increase the productivity is good for the business that's just for the voice communications or for the email, and all aspect of the lifestyle, people are using iPhone. Having said that, we will handle other products other than iPhones. Android phone is already available in the market. We are also willing to grow that. Of course, people will look for SoftBank when it comes to iPhone. But other than iPhone, we will like to further accelerate and promote our smartphone strategy. Now, we need to provide a good explanation to our product to the customers to lead it to the sales. One thing that we have to do is further enhance our sales outlet. SoftBank and Premium Shop is what we have established. And if the shop is certified as a Premium Shop, better level of support can be provided, as well as a broader product range -- product line up can be provided at such shops. So smartphone becomes the center of one's lifestyle. The personal mails can be communicated using the mobile phones. However, not so many people were sending the business related emails on one's mobile phones have. And those two different types of email is now totally integrated with the iPhone. Well, I have taken about 8,000 photographs using iPhone. In other words, the total number of the photographs that I have taken already, iPhone exceeded the photographs that I have taken in my life. Same thing holds true for video, same thing holds true for music. The music that I am storing in iPhone is larger than the musics that I have bought prior to iPhone. Now moving forward, compared with the conventional terminals, smartphone contributions will further go up. This shows the smartphone ratio of the newly bought mobile phone. I think, we are ahead of the general tendency that we see in the industry. Now, I have explained about the first X and the equation towards victory. The second X is PC versus smartpad. iPad has been already introduced to many companies from very high level sophisticate companies to ordinary companies. We are receiving a lot of inquires. We are seeing a very good growth of iPad business. And the logos captured on this slide is just part of the users. Take for example, the sales persons who carry the brochures, who carry the paper-based brochure, several years from now, those paper-based brochures and pamphlets will be totally replaced by smartpad or iPad. The sales work presented while carrying the paper brochure will not be able to exert his full capability. I'm sure [inaudible] will materialize when it comes to application forms everything can be done by iPad or by smartpad. So it could be that time will come that people will be ashamed to bring around the note PCs or netbooks, maybe you need to hide them, because it's going to be very embarrassing or that's too extreme could be, but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I am not blaming somebody, but that could be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the way that we could see the future outlooks in this area. Right after the foundation of SoftBank, we were talking that all the businessman, all the general public who have PCs per person and that time will come sometime soon and those PCs will be all connected with network. So that was the message that IBM telling as a vision of the company. And back then that the people were laughing about my dream or vision, because at the time PCs, computer was just a toy and people will imagine PC as a large computer. But now, those kind of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 way of thinking has been totally gone. And of course, right now most of the people have PCs per person and the most of those PCs are connected via network. And I could say, the same thing could happen to smartpad world. Most of the businessmen, students or housewives will start having one or two smartpad per person because you need to take about some minutes for the booting of the computer, but we only available for two hours, weight 2.8 kilograms, and mouse \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we need to have a mouse for the operations. But compared to that, a smartpad is much superior to the note PC. Myself, of course, using iPad and iPhone on everyday basis, and I'm now saying that there are zero percent of usage in note PC right now. Sometimes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 really sometimes when we need to upgrade iOS or we need to have synchronize that I let my secretary to do, because to save some time. So that's when that I used a PC, but as my policy, I am not touching PC any more and that's how I do it right now, but still life goes on. And I actually know that from my experience, which was not totally the way that I used to live, , because almost everyday I was touching the keyboard and not PCs up until iPhone and iPad is launched. So, almost everyday I was using PC using keyboard. But now totally zero percent and now lifestyle drastically changed and are now generating high productivity. And I believe that applies to the general public as well sometime very soon. Of course, it's different in terms of engineers people. They need to use the PCs for the programmings and other work and that will stay for a while. But most of the general public, I believe that they will be only using smartphone and smartpad for their living. And the situation could be even further convenient and also productivity will increase. So, from my example, I have a keyboard dock at my home and my office, so I can just insert my iPad into the keyboard. But usually I don't really need this keyboard. So, one for each business person and that time will come definitely. Not only one, but sometime it will be two or three units per person. Remote control, sorry, it's not working now. And as of today, there are only a small number of shops that available with iPad, but we would like to increase the numbers of those shops. In Japan, there are about 30 million PCs are sold in year basis. And the desktop ratio showing here and also laptop and netbook, there are those three categories there. And for the future, we expect that the situation will change in this way. So, 30 million annual shipment, end of which desktop numbers will be smaller and smaller, note PC will be smaller and the netbook will be even smaller, and that will be replaced with smartpad. As a matter of fact, myself that will be even more smartpad to be replaced, but the conservative way that this will be the case. And the unit of shipments will be increasing further. In smartpad that we would like to take a number one share in this market. And for your reference, the SoftBank Group employees, there are about 20,000 and how many of them are using and this is the result. 100% employees using iPhone, 100% employees using iPad, and 100% connection in the connectivity Wi-Fi in office, and 96% of employees have account for Twitter and they are using Twitter. So, 20,000 size of the company, and of those 100%, 96% are Twitter. I believe, we are the only one company that's achieving this level even that looking around the world. If the company size is about 100 to 200 employees, there will be some companies which can satisfy this level. But some more than 10,000 level of the company and achieving this level, I believe SoftBank is the only company. And 96% of the employees are using Twitter. I don't think that that's something happening in any other company. Why SoftBank is advanced with this iPhone and iPad, then why we have such initiatives for the iPhone, iPad or Wi-Fi? Because myself leading the people to start and we are building this corporate culture, as you can see from the previous slides, at the time of Vodafone K.K. everything was falling down, including operating income. Because the number of customer base was small compared to competitors and it was the least number of customer base compared to the competitors. Of course, in that case that the handset purchase capability was low and of course disadvantageous for the content, because you cannot aggregate the contents if you don't have enough customer base. In the sales channels, distribution channels that's going to be disadvantageous and still we're not able to allocate it with 800 megahertz frequency band. So everything was disadvantageous for the company back then, and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but we didn't want to use those as excuse to losing the game. But instead we've been achieving the number one net addition and I believe that big difference of that is the corporate culture. So, we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 those companies whose core business was telephone against us as a core business of Internet and who will be advantageous for the future market as a corporate culture. And I believe SoftBank is the only company or operator who is showing the turnaround in terms of ARPU. And I believe this is because all the employees of the company is leading this situation. And this kind of corporate culture cannot be built in one day. So looking at all the operators in the world, I don't believe that there are many operators who have such high penetration of this Internet culture, and I believe that the SoftBank is the most advanced in this area. And I am saying myself that I am the IP person, so the corporate culture is the biggest differentiation and the biggest difference compared to the competitors. So it's not only what kind of models we've been launched or what kind of channel we've been obtained, but those are all tactics for the short-term. The biggest difference is the strategic positioning of the company. That is why that we wanted to encourage all the employees to use these services and products. And now going to the conclusion. In smartphone that we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we'll have to be number one and also in smartpad, equals to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we believe that will be the number one operator in mobile Internet. And that is the simple equation for ours. And another new word \\xe2\\x80\\x93 new figures that I'd like to share with you. We have SoftBank mobile net, a new milestone, 40 million lines. As of today, we have customer base of 24 million. And with 24 million customer base we are aiming at 40 million. And I officially like to make such target as an announcement. But at the same time, we like to increase the profit and also maintain the commitment of bringing down the net interest bearing debt. And at the same time, we'd like to achieve the 40 million lines sometime during 2010 to 2020. So it shouldn't be 2020, but sometime 2001X year. It won't be sometime next year, but sometime between 2010 to 2020. But I won't think that it will take 10 years, but will not happen in next year. So sometime between those time that we'd like to achieve these 40 million. So, once I said that I definitely have to keep that word. So we'd like to bring our customer base to 40 million with stable ARPU and maintain our management efficiency. You could imagine what kind of free cash flow, what kind of operating income, what kind of profit can be achieved. And of course, we will keep our commitment to bring the net interest bearing debt down to zero. So maintaining the profit, year-on-year basis, or if we can lose the profit that's easier thing, but we would like to maintain the profit and also keep the commitment of net debt. But still we would like to achieve the 40 million customer base at the same time that we would like to make sure that one will be the target. I cannot say the specific year or pick up the one single year as a target, but we would like to have some range, because we have some competitors here around in the market. So it's a little bit of range here for the target, and we'll not share with you the specific year, but more than one year, but less than 10 year. That's the kind of a target that we are aiming at. So once again that I would like to summarize, what is our equation is? X+X equals to X. So there are some Mr. X going on in a TV commercial. But this is the equation towards victory. And that we would like to make this happen towards number one mobile Internet company and make people happy through information revolution. And we would like to keep this our policy and vision for the future. Thank you very much. That is all for my presentation. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " '2010 Q3': \"Good afternoon. I am Son from SoftBank. So, our earnings results. I am a big fan of sports, I love golf, baseball, soccer, and the basics - basis of these sports is always to keep the axis. And based on that, you move the legs, arms and everything. And thank you for all your support that we've been able to have a solid base in the SoftBank business. And I am very happy to report you that. And I would like to explain you based on that. Our core base never changed since its foundation. We would like - we want to make people happy through information revolution and also, contribute to the people's happiness. That never changes, and this is the only never changed principle that we've been keeping. But in the past 30 years, we never changed the principle itself and had a same vision keeping all the way through 30 years. Cash flows are boring. Sometimes we've been told that it's not - catch-up is what we do, what is our capabilities. However, now that we've been having a solid base, including the financial position, and I believe that we are now - and the chance that we've been able to expand the base a bit. Now, I would like to go into the detail. This is the - our forecast for consolidated operating income, which was announced in the initial year for year 2010, for full-year basis. And today, we have announced that we like to - we revised - original forecast was \\xc2\\xa5500 billion and we made an upward revision to \\xc2\\xa5600 billion. So, we made a further big step here and this is included in the distributed handouts. In the next page, doesn't really included it in the package, and I want you to just take a look and forget about it - and this is the page I wanted to show. And I want to go to the next page now. So, compared to the competitors, we're making a quite a good momentum, and I believe you can expect what I wanted to say here and I don't want to tell too much of it. But we are making smooth and good progress here. So you see the summary of consolidated earnings results. You can see net sales, EBITDA, operating income, ordinary income, net income, everything. It's making a great progress, increasing in revenue and profit from every aspect. And the comparison to competitors, \\xc2\\xa5100 billion, \\xc2\\xa5200 billion, our level of increase in the profit and revenue, which cannot be seen in the competitors. Net sales, record high, 10% increase year-on-year; EBITDA, 17% increase and a record high for seven consecutive periods; operating income, again record high for six consecutive periods with 32% increase year-on-year; ordinary income, 42% increase; net income, 50% increase. Our financial status, cash flow, operating cash flow exceeded \\xc2\\xa5500 billion is in the three quarters. So, in a full-year basis, we believe we can grow more. In the CapEx, no change in annual plan. Free cash flow, 28% increase. And the net interest-bearing debt, at the time of Vodafone K.K. acquisition, we used cash in whole amount, which was the second-largest acquisition from the past. Usually, it's done by stock, so it was \\xc2\\xa52 trillion level cash acquisition, which is abnormal, and the first thing in the Japanese economy. That's why that we have exceeded net interest-bearing debt over \\xc2\\xa52 trillion and many people worried about it. But with now, with a smooth repayment, we've been able to bring it down to \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level and reduced by \\xc2\\xa5960 billion. And the next slide shows the SBM loan balance, and this is a syndicated loan structured with the bank group. And actually we're making accelerated repayment, compared to the original commitment. Even with this plan that there are many worries and concerns over the market. But as you can see on the page, the payment plan, it has been accelerated. And as a first step towards the refinancing, on page 18, we have acquired the preferred stock issued to Vodafone and Yahoo Japan, as announced earlier. So, with that, I believe we've been making a firm step towards WBS refinancing. Just about two years ago, there was a rumor that our company, as if making bankrupt or anything and many concerns and worries over the newspaper or the magazines. And that made our bond spread high. But recently, I believe that the market understands that that was just a worry and even in the seven-year unsecured straight corporate bond that our interest rate is around 1.66%. So, I believe that has been improved over the years. As a result, at the time of Lehman shock, we - our net interest-bearing debt was \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion. But year 2011, we are targeting to bring it down to half from the \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion. And we like to say that the commitment to reduce net interest-bearing debt remains unchanged. And now, I would like to explain about the Mobile Communications business. Compared to the competitors, from April to December, net additions, we were able to be in the number one position for four competitive years, and actually, year-on-year basis, this pace of net additions is about double. And the number of subscribers is increasing, along with our profit increasing. Cumulative subscribers, those red graphs are the time with Vodafone, as you can see, it was about flat. So, after the acquisition of Vodafone, and six months later, we were facing at number portability. And then many of the people said SoftBank will be the loser amongst those competitors. Then, there are lots of worries from analysts and investors. But as a matter of fact, we're able to turn around, and now having a 10 million increase. Of course, we had some support in management to WILLCOM and that too, I am not going to go into detail, but that's also making a good progress so far, and making a good improvement in the business cycle. So, that's something that we'll be able to expect to added on to our Group, then that number will increase. Churn rate also showing record low, while making good progress so far. TV commercials, four-time champions in terms of Brand of the Year. So, which TV commercials do you remember most and do you like most? That question is done by CM Databank, which is a third-party or independent party. And we've been able to win four times consecutively. And that this is a first thing ever. And with this Father dog, it's really famous now. We stated the ARPU has been improved, and we say a turnaround. Competitors losing ARPU, average revenue per users, that those two competitors facing that decline in ARPU. And in the world market, most of the mobile operators are facing the same problem, but we were able to make a turnaround in ARPU. And the main driver for this increase is coming from data ARPU. Data ARPU is making a big growth, compared to competitors, even in absolute figures. Finally, that we've been able to exceed KDDI in actual data ARPU, and we are taking number two position. You can see the momentum of this graph, and you can see how soon we've been able to have a happiness to share with you. At the time of Vodafone Japan acquisition, we spent about \\xc2\\xa52 trillion, but at the time many people told me that's crazy acquisition because that time operating income was making a big drop as you saw the number of users going flat. But because of the competition, operating income was making a big drop. And that was a time that we made acquisition so that's why that even more people worried about our move. The global big corporate - our Vodafone never been able to success obviously Japanese market, and why SoftBank can make a success and make actually turnaround in terms of revenue, that was the main concerns, and most of the people view in that way. But as you know, in reality we made a big, big improvement since then, and that also became the source of the repayment of the debt. And our weakness that's left is only one thing and that is what we are well aware and that is about the network coverage. And in order to have a great improvement, in March last year we have made a network enhancement initiative that has been launched and you can see the number of base station that have been installed here, and we've been going as scheduled. And in March, we will have 120,000. And in September, we will have 140,000. Compared to 60,000 one year ago, we will have double the number. But once we have 120,000 base stations, are we going to be satisfied? No, I, personally, not. We'd like to have more improvements and that's why we've come up with this new target of 140,000, but we will not stop there. We have to go forward until all the customers are satisfied and we will have a continuous improvement and that's our commitment. And one day - it's not going to satisfy our customers overnight, like over nothing, but we would like to continue to do our improvement. But it's not just us, but DoCoMo and AU do have weakness. That's inside the subway trains. It's not a platform that I'm talking about because on the platform, in some areas, you can get signals. But when the train is running in the subway, there's no signal that you can receive. So, if you spend 30 minutes or one hour every day for commuting, for return trip, and if you cannot get any signals for the whole commuting time, that has to be improved. And I have been talking to this so-called Tunnel Association and I have a run for the Director of the Board and I talked to the Vice Governor last week and I also would be meeting the Governor - or the Mayor of Osaka City this week. And this is not just for SoftBank, but DoCoMo and AU will benefit because we're having this plan for the coverage as from the capacity of this association. And I share this winning formula last time, X + X = X, and this blue part in X is our commitment as SoftBank. We would be number one in smartphone and smartpad, and then we will have number one in mobile Internet. And this is a simple formula and we've been working on this since several years ago. And vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis our competitors, we have been the only one that has been sustaining increased revenue and profits, and we have been able to raise our forecast by \\xc2\\xa5100 billion for operating income on a consolidated basis. And what was the success factor that is all condensed in this one page. But this is not the end. We're not going to stop here, but X + X = X, this formula is what I'm going to explain in more detail. Smartphone - number one in smartphone. In terms of the number of new acquisitions, which models are contributing by what? That's what is shown here. Of course, other companies have smartphones, but there is a certain amount of volume of acquisitions for upgrades by existing subscribers, but for totally new customers, the customers are switching over from other operators. So, how much contribution those new acquisitions have made? That is shown here according to external survey company based on the number of shipments in the volume retailers. And this is the graphical representation of that survey. And in terms of number of new acquisitions, and the customers that are switching over from operators, the iPhone was the largest contribution. And why is it so strong? Of course, we also deal with the Android smartphones and here in Japan, we are working with Google through Yahoo, and they are very important partner. But on a worldwide basis, there were 200,000 titles for applications, but the applications software titles that can be bought by Japanese in Japanese yen is only 600,000. While there are more than 300,000 titles that Japanese can buy in Japanese yen from among the iPhone applications. So how many applications are available that can be bought in Japanese yen? In that sense, it is much more and 98% of the satisfaction level. In the ordinary product customer satisfaction survey, I've never seen such a high score of 98%. But with regard to iPhone, this has achieved that 98%. So, this is an overwhelming product. When the iPhone was first launched in Japan, many experts have said that the iPhone won't sell in Japan, and there are such stories also reported. But actually they turned out to be wrong and it's the consumers that know the best. Android handsets and smartphones, those will be also expanded in the product lineup. But our main focus will be iPhone and iPad. That is not going to change for the time being. And next point in the formula is smartpad. We are at number one in smartpad as well, because in the sales share of smartpad, iPad is the largest and clearly, number one. And it's not just for ordinary consumers, but major corporations are making inquiries about their professional use. And these are the companies that are already using iPad for their business. But as mobile handset users, there have been corporate customers that have never made transactions with SoftBank. But there are many of them who have made - started to use our services. And so iPhone and iPad has been quiet useful for us to develop corporate customers as well. And why is iPad so good? There are 20,000 employees in SoftBank Group and we have distributed 20,000 pieces of iPhone and iPad, so every single employee has both iPad and iPhone. Why? Once you have iPad, then you can save \\xc2\\xa595,000 per month. That's the result that we've seen. So, it's almost nonsense you don't distribute the iPad to each employee. If you just would like to waste your expenses, then you can just distribute the iPad to 10% of the employees, but if you like to save expenses, then you have to distribute iPads to all employees. So, when there is a stock shortage, we were not able to distribute the iPads to all employees, but once we have enough supply then we have distributed to all employees. And they're all happy and we were able to reduce overtime. And we have gone into paperless environment and work time generation has been increased. And all the Directors are also working in paperless environment, and also, home office hours have been increased by three times. You can see how much time has been wasted so far at Japanese companies. And we will also enhance cloud services for corporate users. On the first of this month, we have started the services working with Google and this is exclusive arrangement to Japan. The Google applications for business will be provided on exclusive basis from corporate uses through cloud services and this has been launched on February 1st. And this is the part one of winning formula and part two starts from here. And this is what we call upgraded winning formula. The part one is smartphone and smartpad and mobile Internet, as I explained. And in the part two upgraded winning formula, mobile Internet, number one in mobile Internet plus number one in Asia Internet, then you can get number one in global Internet. And this is what we see as upgraded winning formula and this is what we believe from the bottom of our heart. And toward this vision, we're trying to move forward one step at a time. And I talked about smartphone plus smartpad equals mobile Internet in the winning formula part one, but in this winning formula, this formula had been created before we bought Vodafone K.K. There was a lawsuit filed against MIC asking for more frequency bands. There were lawsuits that were filed because we wanted to enter this industry, because we believed in this winning formula and that was about seven years ago. And we made a strong commitment back then and we also bought a professional baseball team and we bought a professional baseball team not because I was - I loved baseball as a small child, well, there might be some sort of such personal feelings, but we wanted to have more - better communication with ordinary consumers through this baseball team. Because we wanted to become number one in Mobile Internet and we had expected that there will be an era of smartphone and smartpad, and we had to also enhance our promotions and that's why we came up with this winning formula. And this part two is the upgraded winning formula. After we became Mobile Internet number one, then we have to become number one in Asian Internet and if we add these two up, then we would have number one in global Internet, and this is the unshakable upgraded winning formula. This is not just a simple vision, but this is what we strongly believe in and committed to. Then, how exactly are we going to actually solve this formula? There are already preparations made and that's to become number one in Asian Internet. Amongst the Japanese service companies without doubt there are no other Japanese companies that have Internet companies in Asia, so many Internet companies in Asia as SoftBank. We were the only one. Especially in Japan, Yahoo Japan is the core company, and Yahoo Japan has been continuously renewing the record of high level in operating income. And Yahoo in the U.S. has been going through ups and downs, whereas Yahoo Japan has been predominantly number one and continuously achieving record-high every year in terms of operating income, and this is the core for Japan. And in smartphone, for the past two years, it has increased the smartphone page views by 25 times. So, it's not a PC-Internet company, but it is now changing itself to mobile Internet company on a steady basis. Next, I'd like to talk about what we believe is the most important going forward, and that is China. China is going to be more important than Japan. And if you look at the Internet business in China, the market is already larger than that of U.S. and Japan together, Internet population-wise. In the year 2000, about 10 years ago, we made an investment in Alibaba. And seven years ago, we had setup the joint venture, 50/50% joint venture Taobao, with Alibaba for Taobao. And two years ago, we made investment in Renren and being a major shareholder. So, this is the strategic investment that we've been making. In Alibaba, which is the first base and also, the main base, it has been making a great progress so far, already listed in Hong Kong market and making a good progress in terms of subscribers and also, revenue. This is the company, which is the Taobao, hasn't been listed yet. So, I cannot disclose any figures because it's not listed, but this is also making a great improvement in the business itself. Just the one example that I would like to share with you, the payment service used by Taobao, about 99% of the users in Taobao is using the service called Alipay as a payment service, and there are about 550 million people who is using Alipay. The biggest payment service in U. S. was PayPal so far, eBay bought the company and now it's under the umbrella of eBay. And the total number of users on PayPal is now doubled in Alipay. And the next important base is the company called Renren. This company, I believe, has a big potential in the future, and going to be very important base for the business development. Originally called OPI, but they have changed the company's name in December 2010 and now called Renren. Renren in Chinese characters is person and person, so it's connecting people. And for this Renren, we made additional investment, and now our voting rights is 39.7% and being a major shareholder as of last month. The reason why Renren is very important is because when you look at the U. S. market, which is the Internet-advanced country, as you know, the movie called Social Network, the SNS, the social network is very popular and people are spending many of their time in the social network. And now that the share of this time spent is taking number one position, and the biggest example of this social network is Facebook. Facebook, even before listing, but now, its revenue has making a - has been accounted as a 4 trillion for the private estimate. But from my personal view, I believe that the number of the value will be increasing even their number is low because their advertisement revenue is making a great jump. Other than human cost, there is no much cost that is spent and if you grow this much of the advertisement, I believe this is going to be a very good revenue-making company as same as Yahoo. So, from that sense, I believe the value of Facebook will improve rapidly. This Facebook is mainly covered in U.S. market. There are about 140 million subscribers in U.S., but when you see in China, already, Chinese SNS exceeded in terms of number of subscribers. Now, that the China is the biggest market. The biggest SNS in China is the company Renren with it making about 40% of the investment and SoftBank being a media shareholder. And this Renren is making biggest number of users in SNS in China. Anyway, this is the comparison with the competitors in China in that you can see that Renren is taking the biggest lead in terms of SNS. As you know, social network make a good network effect. So, number one becomes even more bigger number one. So, when you have more people, then you have more advantage. That kind of effect will be made from this network effect. So, mainly from Renren, I believe that we can make a bigger business there. This is as of September last year. 100% or the wholly-owned subsidiary of Renren, there is a company called Nuomi. This is a Chinese version of Groupon. Groupon in U.S. has been offered with merger, and they rejected. And the company tried to offer, made an offer it Google, as you know. So, Google was trying to make an acquisition or merger. The offered figure was about \\xc2\\xa5600 billion, and the Groupon rejected the offer. So, there are some problems in Japan, but that was the very small issue. Probably not as small, but from the overall picture, Groupon business model is making a sustainable growth. Same as that, the business in China is also making a great progress. And the number of users in China already made a 500-fold in six months. So, now it's taking about 11.4 million numbers of users, so making a big jump every month basis. And this is up to September base numbers, but even after September making a great movement. And the number one in China is Nuomi in this growing market because this is operated by Renren, which is also the number one SNS in China. So, Groupon business model, we are already being in the number one position, but we want to make it even more. Another announcement that I would like to make is about PPLive. As I mentioned earlier, Internet in China is making a great improvement and growth even bigger than Japan. And on Internet in China, this is the biggest online TV service provided, and the business service has already operated. This is the already advanced business model and not existing in Japanese market. And I believe, this is the world number one, because the number of channel-wise, it's the biggest, number of active users-wise it's also world number one. It covers about 120 TV stations in China, officially contracted. So, in Japanese case, you have a lot of TV stations like in Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Hokkaido or Tokyo or Osaka, Nagoya, those TV stations broadcasting TV program. It's available in Internet, so whole dramas, Friday programs. Every program is available in this service PPLive. In addition to that, this made official contract executed with Hollywood, so that now, dramas, movies are available, and there are about 20,000 channels available in every time, and the quality is DVD quality and you can see it in PC screen in these days with the alliance with set-top box. Then there's the household TV sets also available with this 20,000 channel. And to this company, SoftBank is making investment. And last month, we executed the official contract and already paid in and we became the major shareholder of this biggest Internet TV provider in China. Next, I'd like to show you about 30 seconds video. {Commercial] It covers about 120 TV stations in China and with 20,000 channels; live chat also available and are synchronized with SNS. Multi-angle of broadcast. Even in a football game that you can see the several cameras, animations, dramas, varieties. And as you can see the quality is very high quality. So, it's a DVD quality available, very clearly see, and the number of users already reaching 100 million. About a year ago, it was about 60 million and now reaching 100 million, so it made - the number doubled in one year. So, it's not a registration number, but active user numbers. So, those are the numbers who are actually actively using and already 100 million there. So, this is the number one online TV service with 20,000 channels and not in the slide, but SoftBank becoming major shareholder, but also SoftBank has rights to develop in worldwide market together with PPLive and setting up the joint venture with 50%/50%. So, this service can be developed over to the market, worldwide market. So, that rights also have been held by SoftBank. And PPLive already been seen by Chinese people worldwide about 100 million active users, and about 15% out of that is the viewers outside of China. So, Chinese language, Chinese programs available in U.S., India, or Russia or Mexico. So, same time, live broadcast all available. So, most of the channels are available in the same time. Because in Japan TV stations as an example of making lawsuits so anything that the programs broadcasted in overseas, anything like that. But this is already officially each TV stations allowing and contracting with PPLive to provide program in overall market. It's not a pirate program, it's the official programs. And the reason why the TV station welcome this service is because it's profitable for both PPLive and TV stations. So, in China, net Internet is not anymore enemy of TV service. So, from that sense, China already making a big step forward and we are, our Japanese services are a step behind. So, China - or this service can increase the total viewer - total number of viewers in TV programs. And this is also available for the win-win solutions to both parties. So, I believe, this is very promising and I'm very much excited with this opportunity. At the time when we made an investment in Alibaba, not many people really make a good understanding about these business models. Taobao was also the same. Renren was also same in the - but three years later, five years later, 10 years later, you know what kind of meaning was made to SoftBank. And this PPLive or PPTV, how much impact will it make? You'll never know it now, but maybe 10 years later, you will understand. Maybe you remember Mr. Son was so excited about this. So, you know what kind of things will be available. A single viewer spends two hours and a half per day viewing this channel or this TV. This is every single day, not month, not even a month. The average daily viewing time per person is two-hours-and-a-half. So, this is clearly number one. For example, there is Baidu in China, which is already well-known. It's a Chinese version of Google and Sina, a Chinese version of Yahoo and Sohu, and there are others. However, compared to any other website, the average time spent per user per day is really smaller for other players. And especially in 7, 8, 9, 10:00 at night will be the peak time. And this is the primetime for TV, but actually during this time, people use the PPLive because they have more channels, and the picture quality is not bad, and there will be larger screen of service available. And then Chinese people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, they prefer online TV to ordinary TV in terms of the number of hours that they spent on each of these media. And on TV shopping, in terms of PPLive shopping, it is interactive, whereas on TV it's only unilateral, and you have to make a call when you would like to buy. But in PPLive, with a single click on a live basis, you can buy products that you would like to buy and you also can have a chat, and there's a video streaming of this meeting ongoing. But as you watch the video, you can have tweeting with several hundreds of millions of people on a global basis at the same time, on the real-time basis with good picture quality. And a single click will allow you to buy any products that you would like to buy. So, it doesn't just depend on advertising revenue and this is leading to e-commerce, and how much impact it would have, I think I already have goose bumps concerning this. And the TV advertising market in China is already three times bigger than that of Japan, so in Chinese TV, there is not much hope for advertising revenue that's misunderstanding. And the world's largest DVD - GDP country, China is going to become one. And last month, China has exceeded Japan, and it's just a matter of time, China will also catch up with the U.S. and advertise market for TV is already three times bigger than that of Japan. Therefore, we have become clearly number one in e-commerce in China and in payment and social network services and group buying or coupon group buying model and online TV distribution, we are clearly number one in all of these fields. In other words, in main Internet services business models, we have taken the number one position in all of these fields. And in most of these companies, we are the largest shareholder. And this would be equivalent to Amazon or PayPal or Facebook or Groupon or Netflix or Hulu in the U.S. And as a result, what has happened, for each of the colors in this bar chart, we just counted the number of unique users. So, there is no overlapping. And in each of the colors, we have counted unique numbers. But between different colors, because we are looking at different websites, we have not matched the unique users. So, there may be some overlapping in counting. But in those five major Internet sites in China, we just simply add those unique number of users then we have 1.2 billion users. And even if we exclude the part that is overlapped, probably we can - we are looking at 600 million to 700 million, which is half of the population of China. And these are the users of Internet in China, and this has been four times more than the previous year and four times more than the year before - previous year. So we've been adding up the business in China steadily, and most of those companies that we have in China are private companies, so they are not disclosing their financial numbers, but once they are disclosed it will be much more interesting. So this is the winning formula, upgraded one, mobile Internet, number one; and number one in Asian Internet. And if you are number one in Asia, then you can cover two-thirds of the world's population, and then you can become number one on a global basis. And that's my big vision. And we would like to become Number One Global Internet Company. And why? Because we would like to 'Make People Happy Through Information Revolution.' This is the earnings report meeting that we're having today so we'd like to go back to the numbers once again. As a conclusion, compared to the initial forecast at the beginning of this year - of this fiscal year, we have revised the operating income to \\xc2\\xa5600 billion. And we have made a further preparation to become number one in Asia. So, as another strategic investment, we have included PPLive in China. And this is all for 'Making People Happy Through Information Revolution,', which has been our principle and axis and vision since the foundation of our Company. Thank you\",\n",
       " '2010 Q4': \"Hello, good afternoon. I am Son from SoftBank. Thank you very much for today. So we had a big earthquake this time and we lost and had a lot of sufferers and now that such circumstance, the service that we provide in the communications and the Internet. I, again, realize that how important it is and how it became the lifeline of the people in the country. I myself believe that this business is really something essential for people's life and our network was not enough to provide the communications to the people and I felt that from my bottom of my heart. With that, I would like to explain about the earnings results for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 2011 and also I would like to discuss the CapEx for the coming fiscal year. And during this Golden Week, the holidays, I have visited several countries in Asia and I have received the concerns and the worries from those people over the earthquake in Japan, and at the same time I realized that how successful the Asian countries are in terms of GDP, GNP and also seeing the tremendous growth in terms of the Internet business. And our group is also enhancing our strategy over Asian countries and seeing a lot of opportunity in those areas. So, struggling Japan instead Asia is growing and I see a clearer picture of those two and now I would like to go into my presentation. First of all, I would like to share with you the highlights. Net sales of SoftBank consolidated base exceeded \\xc2\\xa53 trillion, first time ever. Operating income \\xc2\\xa5629.1 billion year-on-year basis, 35% increase. The forecast at the beginning of the period was \\xc2\\xa5500 billion for consolidated operating income, and it was significantly larger than the forecast for this time. And the details and the breakdowns are on this page of the summary of consolidated earnings results. Everything was positive. Comparison with the competitors, our competitors showing some struggles in net sales or stable or a little bit of flat in operating income, but on the other hand, we have been showing the revenue and profit increase. And consolidated net sales basis, after we entered into the mobile phone market, we have been making a drastic change towards positive way and the consolidated EBITDA also showed great results. In this year, we have increased it by 18%. Consolidated operating income, we have 35% year-on-year increase after this launch of ADSL and having some red numbers shown due to the ADSLs. However, compared to that situation in about six to seven years ago, we have been achieving quite a lot since then. In operating income, in absolute figure-wise, compared to the competitors of those two operators, we've been making remarkable growth. Looking at the KDDI, we have exceeded theirs. And now that we are seeing two catching up, we can expect or forecast sometime soon that we can catch up with DOCOMO. In terms of operating margin this year, first of all that we have been able to surpass NTT DOCOMO. Usually, those operating margin is better shown in those larger size of the company because of the scale merit. However, as with the smaller base, this time, we're able to show the best in terms of operating margin, and I believe this is due to the business efficiency which has been improved dramatically. In Mobile Communications business, which is the largest part of ours, and two competitors showing negative 9% or positive 1%. But us, we were able to increase by 54% in year, which I believe is a dramatic increase. So looking at the world operators, mobile operators more specifically and especially for those mature and especially for those matured market areas. I don't believe there is no much operator which has shown this 54% lever of the operating margin increase. And in looking at the companies in Japan, in terms of operating income, we were able to record number three, NTT is the first, NTT DOCOMO second, and us as the third. And I believe the gap in between those second and third is narrower. Ordinary income was 53% increased. Net income was 96% increased year-on-year. This 96% is after considering the special loss caused by the disaster which is \\xc2\\xa514.4 billion. Operating cash flow 24% year-on-year increased. Free cash flow 44% year-on-year increase. Just about 2.5 years ago, we had a Lehman shock. At that time, we were number one in terms of more slightly bankrupt, and I was not sure why we were selected as such company, but the people were telling that we were about to bankrupt, something like that. That has been covered in TV programs or magazines articles and our share price also went down drastically. At that time, I have made an announcement that we will achieve the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion for the free cash flow in three years. And many people doubted about that and people are saying that I am liar again. That was the kind of remark that I have seen. But actually 1 trillion free cash flow in three years, but we have already aggregated \\xc2\\xa5952.2 billion in two years and a half. So, we can say that we are almost there in two and a half years compared to the three years commitment of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So, this free cash flow is the result for the repayment of the debt. So, we've been often told that we are having too much debt and we'll never be able to repay those debts. But you can see that from this slide, the dotted line are the original schedules for the repayment and the actual line is our repayment pace. So, actually, that we have been accelerating the repayment of the debt. And the outstanding balance for mobile loan is \\xc2\\xa5627 billion. Under the consolidated basis, we have already reduced over half from the peak time and \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion which was the time of the Lehman shock ended this fiscal year. As scheduled, we have the net interest bearing debt. As a result we've been \\xe2\\x80\\x93 improved the rating to A Zone for the first time in 11 years. And the dividend per share as announced at the time of Lehman shock, \\xc2\\xa55 billion per share. No change for that and for this fiscal year we are expecting to increase some. So looking back the past that the five years has passed since we entered into Mobile business and we have figures 5, 6 and 7 and what is those numbers, you may wonder. Five refers to the profit that became 5 times, six refers to 6 times of the base station numbers and seven refers to 70% increase in terms of customer base. After we purchased our mobile operation from Vodafone and we've been complained that the communication connection is not well yet or the 3G base station is not enough. But however, actually, we have increased the base stations by six times, so we like to start with this five-figure. So red bar graphs are the operating income at the time of Vodafone. So you'll see that drastic decrease and if you wait there for one year that would go down below zero that was the most likely case in the expertise forecast for Vodafone Japan. Under such circumstances, which was a risky gamble to pay so much money to buy such operation and that is why that we've been accused for that. But, as a matter of fact, this was the big turning point for our business and so that we were able to increase our business growth. In the operating income for Mobile Communications business only has been already increased by five times. The number of base stations right after the acquisition of the operation, it was 21,000. At the time of negotiation, it was about 18,000. And the management of Vodafone K.K was saying that the 20,000 base stations will be enough and 20,000 was a kind of doubtful figure but after we purchased this business, we're still having some difficulties not having a good connection so we have decided to increase the number of base stations after then and a year ago, as I started Twitter, and a lot of customers complained and gave me a message that it doesn't have a good access. So as of March this year, we would like to double the number of base stations to 120,000 and many people say that we'll never be able to do so, but as scheduled, we've been able to reach this number which is the six times of the numbers. I'm not satisfied yet and I still see those areas, white spots that we need to provide a good coverage. So, to be equivalent to AU or DOCOMO's coverage, we have to keep working and, of course, the competitor is going to put every effort to increase their capability. So we believe that this is the never-ending competition or never-ending investments. But for now, as of today in favor of AU or DOCOMO that we need to catch up. We don't have allocated with 800 megahertz, those kind of excuses that I could make any or lots of excuse, but regardless of those that we need to keep working and making efforts until we have a good coverage and a good connection of the network. With those efforts, we've been able to accumulate subscriber base by 70% compared to the time of Vodafone K.K. but then was 50 million so we have increased by 10 million since then. And also, we have strategies for further growth. Our business model is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are confident with our business model, which is sustainable. So not really aiming to the short term profit, but we should aim for the 5 to 10 years growth and further CapEx increase or enhancement of the base stations. And I don't want to hear anymore no connecting SoftBank anymore. So I have to put every effort to achieve that goal. So with that, I would like to increase the CapEx and also enhance the customer acquisitions. So that is the mid to long-term profit base of the future growth. So, in the next two years, this year or next year, we are planning to do a CapEx of \\xc2\\xa5500 billion. In the last one year, we have spent a record high of \\xc2\\xa5420.5 billion in CapEx. And this year and next year, for two years in a row, we will be surpassing that amount so we will be spending \\xc2\\xa5500 billion or so. During the Vodafone Japan era and even before that, it's still record high. By the way, CapEx per subscriber, AU, DOCOMO, their CapEx per subscriber is \\xc2\\xa510,000 or \\xc2\\xa511,000 at size. In the last one year, CapEx per subscriber of SoftBank was certainly below \\xc2\\xa515,000. Even though SoftBank is criticized as not doing a lot of CapEx, in fact, we are number one in our CapEx per subscriber, we surpassed our competitors and we would go beyond even that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we will surpass even our record. And basically, we will continue to invest until the connectivity is a complete satisfactory. And this year and next year, we can make those capital expenditure \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we should see a lot of improvement and significant in contents \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 improvement in the contents therefore, we should be able to finish up the CapEx around that time, and so that should be about the peak. Now, some other backgrounds for this CapEx is this frequency allocation. We want coverage to be within the building as well and with this frequency we can improve the efficiency but because SoftBank does not have 800 megahertz, which has been the greatest challenge for SoftBank because we only had 2 gigahertz. We recently have received an allocation for 1.5 gigahertz, so we have been able to reinforce our data transmission, but most important is that 800 megahertz equivalent which is 700 megahertz and 900 megahertz bandwidth permit. And this year it's the peak for that and hopefully next year we will receive official approval permit for 700 and 900 megahertz. Now, I don't want to use this as an excuse, DOCOMO and KDDI, up until now they have had this golden frequency spectrum. So we are right in the order \\xe2\\x80\\x93 next in line to receive the megahertz. And if this is reallocated somewhat to some other players, we will be so upset that we will basically turn the table upside down. So we believe that they understand our frustrations and so with this assumption, assuming that we will receive this frequency band then we will need to make the capital investment for this frequency. So from this year until next year, latter half, we will reinforce our capital expenditure. So with this frequency and with this CapEx, SoftBank with a poor reputation of connectivity can be overturned, I think that challenge can be overcome. So in the next three years rather than to pursue prioritized profit, I think we will focus on building and establishing our bases, and particularly with this earthquake, one of the things I felt very apologetic about and something that I was very regretful was about those bases. So it's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 shows my determination to prove that. So basically, information is lifeline and this is fulfilling our social responsibility as well and mission. So this is a reconfirmation of our mission. Just immediately after the disaster, base stations were destroyed, damaged. There was no power connectivity, so there was no telecommunication and the base stations were swept away. So there was no connection and the optical fibers was cut off which were connecting the base stations, but it just so happened that in order to build these 120,000 base stations, we just so happened to had this satellite base stations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 satellite stations, we had the equipments ready for that. This is particularly in the mountains or in the remote areas. We can have established connections there. So, we have this equipment and facility for the satellite base stations and so we were prepared. And what we did was we brought this to the disaster ridden sites and used it to restore and recover the base stations. So even today, nearly 150 or so, a significant number of base stations are based on satellite and we also have placed power generators as well for the recovery. Now, Tohoku and Kanto together we have a slightly less than 20,000 base stations, and in fact 19,950. 81% was not affected by the earthquake. 19% was affected by the disaster, but as of today, almost nearly 100% have been recovered. Now this tentative recovery from the satellite base stations and of course, and the inclusion of power generators as well, but I would say that we have been able to recover nearly to the state of pre-earthquake. Now, in terms of reconstruction support, there was 36 items that I have said, let's do it, among which 26 we have already been able to implement already. For example, free mobile phone rental at the evacuation centers and volunteers increasing, available messages and disaster message boards from 3 to 80 and many other items that we have able to implement and complete. So, I can make that declaration for 26 items. We have established reconstruction support portal. One of our group company, a subsidiary called USTREAM. Through this channel, we have been able to broadcast the disaster situation throughout the world using the media from NHK or other private broadcasting stations. And the total access was over 68 million people in terms of unique users, on a monthly basis it's 9.83 million, millions have viewed them on live basis. Another point, this is before the earthquake. We had bailed out WILLCOM, which is suffering with poor management. So we extended management support but during the disaster, we were helped by WILLCOM, DOCOMO, AU, SoftBank, because customers, users, used the cellphone all at once. There was a congestion including fixed lines as well. So there was a very poor connectivity of the phone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 telephone. So at that time, only WILLCOM had a good connection, hardly without any problems. So WILLCOM's PHS performed better than any mobile phones during the disaster, and this was known before but it was proven once again. Therefore, PHS proves itself, and we were helped by WILLCOM. Now, before the earthquake, between January and March, in the three months, January and March, for the first time in four years, we have realized net additions. This is before the earthquake and even after the earthquake, we continued to see net additions. So it's been a long time since we've had \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WILLCOM has experienced net additions on a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so it's been the first time in four years since they have experienced net additions on a quarterly basis. WILLCOM was in de facto bankrupt because they have struggled for a number of years. But since they have come under the umbrella of SoftBank and they have, all at once, been able to turn around with positive profitability and net additions. So we're happy that we have been able to bail out WILLCOM. And also in terms of datacenters, as a result of this disaster, last year, average monthly orders was 15 racks. But we have received orders for this one month \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for this one year worth in just one month this year immediately after the disaster. Because datacenters are all centralized in Kanto, in Tokyo and companies have felt the risk and the need for this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 disperse of risk so that is why they are ordering more racks to us. And we also have recognized this demand, the need for it. So we have decided to form an alliance with KT Corporation. KT is Korea Telecom. This is like in NTT in Korea. It's a business alliance. We will be using the datacenter and cloud business. So for example, if there's a need for backup center for the Japanese company in Japan, then they have it, not only in Korea but in Singapore and China and other parts outside of Japan. But Korea is closest to Japan and, in fact, utility cost is much cheaper as well. Data center is a very power-consuming business, so to have a back-up center in Korea will protect the data, which is lifeline for many companies. And I know that this will be a very welcoming factor for many companies. And just because the data center is relocated overseas, it doesn't mean that there'll be leakages. Of course, the security of data will be guaranteed whether it's in Japan or outside of Japan. Furthermore, we have solutions for working from home. Even if you work out of home, we can maintain security. So we will \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have been able to develop such a system and we will be rolling this out to all 20,000 employees of SoftBank. And we will also reduce contributors for their reduction of power by 30% which is used at the office. And also, there's a disaster and employees cannot commute, they will be able to continue to work from home. So this is something we would like to secure and guarantee for safety and security of the company. And SoftBank as a group made a donation of \\xc2\\xa51 billion for relief and aid. My personal donation is outside of this and it's already been disclosed. I think it was Nikkei BP. According to their survey, there was a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what is the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 pleasing appealing companies and SoftBank ranked number one in terms of the most appealing company in Japan and this was due to the swift response to the disaster. I believe that we were appreciated for our swift response. So, we would like to continue to fulfill our social responsibilities and missions to be a company that's favored and appealing to the society. From here though I'd like to discuss about Mobile Internet to become number one. So, from now on, we would like to further enhance the smart part or smartphone, and thanks for waiting. Last month, April 28th, we have launched white model of iPhone 4. I'm already using this too which is very good. Just changing the color just makes me happy of that. And this was really a big \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great taste of Steve Jobs and only to change this color into white and we've been waiting for more than one year, but this is something that they've been working on very hard to make a beautiful and clear white. It's only to turn into white, it should be launched earlier. That's the kind of general understanding, but that is something different for Apple or Steve Jobs I believe. And I believe they did a good job on this model. It is very beautiful white color. And with this effort, not only Japan, but also in another countries in the world that the iPhone has been received pretty well in accelerating and then especially looking at the female users has been increased dramatically, and I believe this white model can drive even more customers' traction of female users. And now that it's coming closer to 50% of the users, female users, I don't believe the competitors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 smartphone users are like that but iPhone is showing such high ratio of female users. iPad 2 also was launched in April 28th, the same day. I also have been using. It is very convenient and very happy to use this. Plus, the other day, I had a business trip to overseas and in that country I have met one person and the iPad 2 may not be good battery life, but I said battery life became even better than iPad first original version. The design is good. But probably the issue is, this person has been using even more longer time than iPad 1 time, so that is why that he cannot sustain the good battery life of iPad 2. And he agreed with that idea that because after he changed to iPad 2, he's been even more frequently using iPad 2, not only in business but also in daily life, and this is a great product. Faster, thinner and lighter, so those three advantage and on top of that has both side camera. And for this iPad 2, we have launched the iPad 2 for everyone. So it's actually zero yen. And you may asked that the communication fee is expensive but that's not true, you have a data packet or flat rate service which is cheaper than competitors DOCOMO or AUs communication charge for packet flat even though that the screen or display size is much larger. And the hardware itself is actually free of charge, so this I could say is the most attractive price for the consumers and Apple was also surprised with that too. So substantially it is zero yen. Companies that we introduced are willing to introduce tablets within one year is increasing drastically, so we assume tablets will be even more popular compared to netbook. So that was the Mobile Internet number one strategy and the next is the towards number one Internet in Asia. Asian GDP as you all know making a drastic growth, those countries that I visited this time, 8%, 9% growth is just a common sense. It's happening in all of the places. In the past 20 years in Japan, we were about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 experiencing about zero growth. Average GDP is zero for 20 years and compared to that, Asian countries are growing and growing. So you see GDP shares by area in last year, Asian ratio was 25% but we're expecting 44% in 20 years. So the Asia will be leading the worldwide. About 300 year ago, the world population, world economy, two-thirds were China and India. So even though that they will span this 300 years, but once again, China and India is taking two-thirds of population and economy. Such era is coming in mid to long term. That's my personal expectation. So in 20 years, about 44% of GDP will be coming from Asia. So that kind of era is coming very close. We said that we have in those Asian Internet group in SoftBank and we would like to enhance that furthermore. And last week, our group companies, one of the group companies, which is the biggest social network operator in China, Renren, went public at New York Stock Exchange. There was almost zero coverage in TV and the newspaper in Japan, but it was a big news in US and in China, only in Japan, but there is no such coverage about this article. And after the announcement of this IPO, our share price went down and I wondered why that happened, but the first investment we made was the time 2008 April. Latest investment was January this year. In average wise about two years in a row and we have seen the five times growth from 41.8 billion only with our holding rights is becoming 200 billion. So, market cap of Renren is becoming \\xc2\\xa5600 billion. So, at the time of the original investment decision, before the investment it was about \\xc2\\xa570 billion. So, I see a tremendous growth, which is about five times. In IRR in two years or so we'll be making several investments, but now 130%. It's not the 30%, but it's 130% IRR. So, 1.3 times only in two years, and so with this size of the amount it's not that easy thing to happen, but still we're seeing some decline in SoftBank share, which is a surprise to see. But I believe people will understand gradually. After the IPO of Renren, we have 33.4% of voting right share and we are the leading shareholder. Number of Internet user in China is about twice as much of US and it's still growing. It's equivalent to Facebook in US or Groupon in US which are Renren.com and also Nuomi, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renren. And those two are the business model equivalent to Facebook or Groupon in US. Number of users in Renren, activated users, 117 million, making up great growth and number of advertisers that was 139 companies, but now hitting 248 companies. Web based game developers in China in social network operators, it's becoming one of the biggest social network. Nuomi charged users September and December 2010 and also showing the March 2011 and you can see only in six months making such a growth, almost doubled. And we have these Asian countries. And now another company that I fell in love with is not listed yet, but this is the number one online TV in China called PPLive. I also met management of this company, making a great growth. Only a number of month, the active users already exceeded 100 million steady increase in 100 million. You can compare with Netflix in US, this is the service using Internet and viewing the videos. About 20 million in market cap is \\xc2\\xa51 trillion being already public in providing the video and streaming service and also making a good growth. But actually, the number was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the users, number of users, 100 million. For cable TV in US it's about stable with number of users, but only in China, PPTV are already exceeded double the number of users. And that we would like to extend this business towards the outside of China and we are the leading shareholder of that company as well. And another company, Hulu, is the 10 million number of users and 5 hours and 35 minutes for the monthly viewing hours, PPTV on the other hand having 100 million number of users so about 10 times of the number of users, and also, average steady viewing time is 3 times of Hulu. So number of users times number of hours, so which is 30 times. So you can see how much potential the PPLive has that you can understand from this graph, I believe. And this is the first TV for iPad in February, and also acquired exclusive live broadcast rights for Chinese Soccer League. Up to here is PPLive, but not only in China but also in Japan, today we made an announcement on a joint venture with YOSHIMOTO KOGYO. SoftBank to spend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 invest in 60% YOSHIMOTO to invest 40% to set up the joint venture called Contents Bank, and not only here in Japan but also towards the other countries. Another announcement we made is about one of the biggest online shopping website which is Gilt. So we make our investment in Gilt in US and also setting up the joint venture, Gilt Japan. So this is the online shopping and as an e-commerce transaction that we provide the shopping for the customers, with the coveted brands at discounted price. So these are the partner brands, Dunhill [indiscernible] (46:45), Armani's, CELINE those well-recognized brands are the partner of Gilt. Number of user of Gilt, 3.5 million also making a tremendous growth. So with this that we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and Gilt is going to set up the joint venture of 50% and 50% and also making the investment in Gilt with \\xc2\\xa55.2 billion. And we would like to see a great synergy generation with know-how utilizing iPad to allow customer for online shopping. Also, one of the largest shopping sites in Japan or e-commerce, ZOZOTOWN, and we have reached agreement with that today to set up the ZOZOTOWN China. ZOZOTOWN, as you know, has already went public with a 100 some billion yen market cap and making increase in transaction value. So as one of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 become one of the largest e-commerce site in Japan. And ZOZO, in Japan already exceeded 3 million. So Gilt was mainly having customers in US and ZOZO also having about 3 million customers. So ZOZOTOWN and ZOZOTOWN China will be established so we have reached an agreement which start today. So in China, fashion brands are the largest e-commerce. This site in China, you can see that just the fashion shopping sites alone are seeing a remarkable growth. Taobao's largest category is fashion. So in this fashion category, we want to invite Gilt Japan and Gilt is also venturing into China. Gilt China and ZOZOTOWN is also venturing into China. So SoftBank is establishing a 50/50 joint venture in order to also do business in China. ZOZOTOWN has \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will be dealing with over 1,500 brands in China. And they will use Taobao's platform to engage in this business. So ZOZOTOWN and SoftBank will work with Renren and Alibaba, then PPTV, Taobao Group. We formed an alliance with these different companies in China. We would like to realize synergy like this. And so we want to connect people throughout the world globally with information and we want to make people happy through information revolution. So this is the summary. We will continue to pursue revenue and profit growth, but in the next two years, we will prioritize CapEx and customer acquisition. And as I have just announced, because Asian Internet market is expanding rapidly, we would like to also expand our business in Asia. And with B2B, Alibaba alone, it's more than \\xc2\\xa51 trillion and Renren is nearly \\xc2\\xa5600 billion. So you can see the steady growth in the business in China that our business in China is bearing fruit. And we would like to continue to reinforce this business in China and Asia. Thank you very much for your kind attention. That is all.\",\n",
       " '2011 Q1': \"I am Son from SoftBank. Thank you very much for today. So this March, we had this big earthquake and we faced a lot of difficulties of the state. I believe there are still a lot of people who are suffering from the earthquake, and I really like to extend my deepest sympathy to those people. In Europe or U.S. we're seeing some uncertainty in the financial market. And then under such circumstance, there are several events or things happening here and there. But at SoftBank we are strongly working on the development of our business. Of course we do facing these difficulties and trying to support directly and indirectly to those affected people other than the core business of ours. Together with that considering the current situation of the power supply, which is not our core business, but hoping that we may be able to contribute to the society to some extent with this renewable energy. And that is why that we've been making some activities and initiatives in addition to our core business under such circumstance. But we've been making steady progress in our core business, and myself, personally believe in our mission to make steady progress in our core business. And there is a mission as a representative of the listed company and I remember that all the time. So today, I would like to make an announcement about the statement of our core business and how that we were going to address for the future. So we have three highlights; first of all operating income. We have recorded high for six consecutive periods. Second of all, net income which was record high in the five times year-on-year basis. Three, tradable refinance. With that we've been able to improve the financial strength significantly. And you see the summary of consolidated earnings results. Net sales, EBITDA, operating income, ordinary income, net income, as you can see those figures in every aspect we've been able to improve our business. First the consolidated net sales, 9% increase, EBITDA 12% increase and a record high for eight consecutive periods. Consolidated operating income \\xc2\\xa5175.8 billion, which was 12% increase and a record high for six consecutive periods. Maybe not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 should not make a comparison too much with the competitors, but for your reference in the industry, I'd like to show this slide which is the consolidated operating income and we've been able to exceed KDDI's operating income and also recorded high for six consecutive periods. Ordinary income also made a 9% increase and we got high for six consecutive periods. Net income, 5 times year-on-year, \\xc2\\xa594.7 billion, of which \\xc2\\xa513.9 billion is the one-time gain that came from the dilution gain from changes in the equity interest from Renren IPO in New York Stock Exchange. This is not a sales by ourselves, but from this listing we had a dilution gain and this was \\xc2\\xa513.9 billion, other special income, but other than this most of the part is coming from our core business, not the one-time profit. In net income, up until last year, as mentioned in earlier page, operating income, we exceeded KDDI. But in net \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in terms of net income we've been below KDDI. However, this term, in addition to operating income, but in the term of net income we've been able to surpass KDDI in 5 times year-on-year basis. Cash flow, different from last year, we have impact of the sales of installment sales receivables, so for that portion we have some decrease, but other than that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's just a kind of a main part for the movement for the cash flow. And net interest-bearing debt, we've been halved compared to the peak time. Of course, this peak time was a time of the acquisition of Vodafone K.K. and because that was made under the cash basis, so that is why that we had a jump in the net interest-bearing debt. However, we've been able to reduce by \\xc2\\xa51.3 trillion in five years and now we've been able to make that half, which is the earlier pace than we scheduled in the original schedule. And as we made a commitment we will steadily make a reduction in this debt towards the end of the fiscal year. In the refinance of acquisition finance Vodafone K.K. we had a large loan but since then we've been making great progress in our business. And we had about 1% of the interest rate under the weighted average, but this time, with this refinance we've been able to make that down to 1.4%. So with that we'll be able to have a lighter interest rate. Up until now, as a collateral we had an asset of Mobile Communications business, et cetera, but with this refinance there will be no restriction on this collateral so that any gain from here can be used in SoftBank. Thanks to this refinance, our interest payments are to be paid has been reduced by approximately \\xc2\\xa560 billion. So that, we're expecting the reduction \\xe2\\x80\\x93 large reduction of the interest payment in the ordinary income, so that, for the ordinary income and the net income we will be able to expect the increase there from this reduction of the interest. As a result, our rating has been improved largely. So it's been a while, but we've been making good progress this time. And at the time of [indiscernible] (10:41) we made a commitment to make it half of the net interest-bearing debt from the time of fiscal year 2008 with \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion and we are under the schedule or to achieve that commitment to make it half by the end of this fiscal year. And I'd like to go on to the Mobile Communications business. Net subscriber additions, overwhelmingly number one again and MNP or mobile number portability port-in or port-out. We've been receiving port-in customers from DOCOMO and the KDDI. Most of those customers are coming to SoftBank in total. So we're seeing the reduction in competitors and those customers are coming into SoftBank .and also WILLCOM which is substantially under our umbrella made a bankruptcy and we had salvations and include into our Group company which was at the end of last year, and since then all of a sudden it turned around to net addition instead of net loss. So this was in five years since the first over 200,000 net additions and that business itself has been improved dramatically. So at the time of Vodafone K.K., number of users almost flat, but after the SoftBank \\xe2\\x80\\x93 acquisition by SoftBank it's making a great success and after WILLCOM coming under our umbrella it's making great growth. So in total we have exceeded 30 million cumulative subscribers. It is double the time of Vodafone K.K.'s number of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 number of subscriber base. So along with the increase of customers, next focus is ARPU. And again, we exceeded KDDI in terms of data ARPU in absolute figures. Gross ratio we have already exceeded, but in absolute figures of data ARPU, we've been able to exceed KDDI. And for your reference, this data operation, not voice ARPU, but the data ARPU will be the key for the industry competition and that is a big trend right now. And we're hitting 58% of the data ARPU which is the number one in the world. So data ARPU ratio we have already exceeded 50% and now reaching to 58% which is the number one in the world compared to Vodafone, SingTel, Verizon. They include SMS in their data ARPU calculation. Actually we do not include the SMS in the data ARPU and are already hitting 58%. For the overseas operators, even they include SMS for the calculation, but still around 30% to 40%. So you can see how we've been successful in terms of the data ARPU. Of course, at the time of Vodafone K.K. it was behind than the AU or DOCOMO. So mobile communication business telecom revenue increased 13% year-on-year it's been growing steadily. Now telecom revenue rate of increment, again we are number one. The second place is AT&T over in United States and third place is America M\\xc3\\xb3vil and we are ahead of any other companies in terms of telecom revenue rate of increment. Now compared to our Japanese competitors NTT \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually NTT DOCOMO and AU recorded negative growth. So our Japanese competitors recorded negative growth, but SoftBank recorded positive growth and the growth rate is number one in the world. As a result our revenue income \\xe2\\x80\\x93 operating income is increasing steadily. Under the Vodafone K.K. the company was losing income, but once it become part of SoftBank, the business is growing income steadily. And one of the reasons behind the growth is marketing. This is about same preference ranking. And all the commercials of SoftBank, I'm involved in a design or planning of commercial of SoftBank. And daily I check the result of surveys on a daily basis, but it's really hard to win Triple Crown in terms of same preference ranking. We are number one in terms of the ranking by company and by brand and by production. It's really hard to win Triple Crown. In the past Suntory is one of the -- such companies but once we started focusing on marketing the Suntory lost its position, and for the past five years only SoftBank, NTT DOCOMO, Aflac and AC Japan, only those four companies won Triple Crowns. And actually, we won 28 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we won Triple Crown 28 times out of 33 surveys. Again, we were \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are focusing on marketing and we're producing the results. Another survey result, this has nothing to do with TV commercial directly, but this is about the pleasing and appealing company survey. And until recently we were not ranked number one, but in the recent three months we were ranked number one for three consecutive months. So in summary, 11 year in profit increase with record high profit, and significant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we significantly improved capital structure and we continued robust growth trend in Mobile Communications business. Now, we're facing the national crisis, so outside of the core business, I'm caring about initiatives for renewable energy. There are 47 prefectures in Japan and out of that prefecture governors of 35 prefectures joined the Renewable Energy Governors Alliance and I serve as Chairman. And private companies will be joining the alliance as a sub-member and our first meeting was held the other day. Ordinance decreed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our government decreed cities, actually 19 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 out of 19, 17 such cities mayor also attended a meeting held two days ago. And in the meeting we discussed that we're going to make a policy recommendation. And SoftBank in the annual general meeting of shareholders, it was resolved that the SoftBank will be participating such renewable energy initiatives. And as SoftBank we're going to bridge concerned parties of renewable energy initiatives. What is important now is that in the face of national crisis, especially energy crisis, Japan needs to secure the power supply structure. At least one structure is necessary, and once the structure is built, then a lot of companies, or local governments, or individuals can participate in power generation. And actually in 50 countries in the world the fueling tariff system related bills passed already in terms of gross metering. And in Japan there is no such legislation or a bill, but we'd like to push forward a model \\xe2\\x80\\x93 build a model case in terms of solar farm, wind farm and geothermal power generation. And to that end we're going to build an experimental site or a test site and take \\xe2\\x80\\x93 collect data of solar power generation. And data collected from test site will be used as a reference for the future projects or initiatives, but again this is not our core business. Like I said earlier, our core business is making profits steadily and renewable energy initiative will have first half of when does it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 pursuit of our consolidated income, maybe 1% to 2% of our consolidated net income. So this initiative will not affect our business. And our \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 earlier I said that we have a financial commitment and even we're taking part in the new energy initiatives. We will not change our financial commitment and this energy initiative will have limited impact on our consolidated business result. Now SoftBank is doing a lot of things. So I think a lot of people are wondering what SoftBank is doing. What \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so I'd like to answer the question now. So what is true identity of SoftBank? When we acquired Vodafone K.K. we received a lot of questions back then. The mobile phone business reached maturity. The market was matured already, so why does SoftBank enter the market taking out the biggest loan in the company's history which is worth \\xc2\\xa52 trillion? So why did SoftBank take such big risk? Upon the announcement our company's share price fell sharply and a lot of harsh questions came in. And at that time I said that I didn't intend to make a telecom company. Please look at the video footage at that conference. What we are aiming for is to become a lifestyle company in the 21st century, not just a voice communication service company, but a comprehensive digital information service company is our goal. So please don't call us a comprehensive communication company. My vision is not that small. Once again, what we were aiming for is comprehensive digital information service company, which is a lifestyle company in the 21st century. Thank you very much. That was five years ago and I was surprised I already lost my hair. Anyway, I said don't call us a telecom company. That's what I said at that time. So what we are aiming to be is not a voice communication company or just a mere mobile phone operator. That's what I told at the press conference, not a voice communication company, digital information service company is what we were aiming to be or I should say mobile internet company, that's what we were aiming to be since the acquisition of Vodafone K.K. Then how do you categorize iPhone? Is that mobile phone or is it voice communication, is the main function of iPhone? No, there are a lot of device, communication device for voice communication. So in that sense, the voice communication market was matured already. But in my view iPhone is machine, Internet machine and iPad is also Internet machine or the device or handset for Internet is iPhone and tablet for Internet is iPad. So we don't intend -- we didn't intend to run a telecom company. Let's look back our history. We started as a whole distribution -- distributor of software. When SoftBank was listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange we were categorized as wholesaler or trading company, and I raised objection to TSE officers, we are not the wholesaler. I raised objection repeatedly but TSE officers said that you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what you're doing is transporting software on your truck and sell it to the shops. Again we acquired Ziff Davis which is publishing company, and that was the paper media publishing company we acquired Ziff Davis. So TSE said, you are a publishing company and I said, no. What I'd like to do is Internet business and to lay the groundwork I need a map and compass to go that road, and that's why I acquired Ziff Davis. When we were running our distribution of software we were aiming to be an infrastructure company, and through that infrastructure digital information will spread and be shared by a lot of people. That way a lot of people can enjoy Internet. That's what I said from the foundation of this company. Again, Yahoo is also Internet company. When I acquired telecom, some people said, are you going to acquire the fixed communication company? And I said, no. For the Internet infrastructure, we need a fixed line network. And when I acquired Vodafone some people said, are you going to run a mobile phone business? And I said, no. My goal is running Internet business, but since the foundation of my company, I kept saying that I'm going to run Internet business or Internet platform. So every business within the Group contributes to the mission of becoming number one, Internet company. So all the companies are stepping stone to become number one, Internet company. So I believe that those steps are to be made was a kind of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 become advantageous for us. So digital information service or digital information industry, we would have become the number one, which means we want to become number one in Internet. So our winning \\xe2\\x80\\x93 true winning formula, this slide comes again and again, but becoming a number one in mobile Internet and also number one in Asia Internet, as a result that we will become number one in global internet. To become number one in mobile Internet, we've been making several steps and initiatives, iPhone, iPad, those are the very important steps and milestones. Smartphone is going to become a boom. So if not the smartphone then there would not be a mobile phone that's the kind of a day that we'll be seeing sometime in near future. So in four years the number of smartphones sold in Japan, we're expecting about five times. And of each smartphones sold DOCOMO, KDDI compared to them that we've been over them and number one. So as I said that if it's not smartphone, it's not mobile phone. By the time that the situation comes true that the cumulative number of shares-wise DOCOMO is larger. Maybe some time that we will exceed KDDI and we've been seeing that as a target. So, we're already expecting this smartphone boom era, and we're taking a lead on that. iPhone not only for the geek phones, but actually that we think female users among new iPhone subscribers exceeding 50% not as a cumulative numbers, but for those customers coming newly and using iPhone or buying iPhone, we think 50% or more in from female. So once that you see this 50% coming from female, it's not the boom anymore, but it's already a culture. So it's not a one-time thing. So iPhone became a culture of Japanese society, that's how I see the situation. iPhone ratio among new student subscribers, so students comes in to become the subscriber of mobile phone and at that time, which handset they want to use as a new subscriber. And about 70% made a debut of mobile phone with iPhone, including those junior-high or high schools. So if this is a first mobile phone for those students, they will go on with those handsets. Maybe there will be some hesitation to change to the other models. I think that's most of the peoples' feeling, because they don't get satisfied with the other handsets. Most of the students tend to choose those conventional handsets in the past, so called Galapagos models, but now already you see in the previous slide more than 52% of the female users are choosing iPhone for their new handset. And for new students of the SoftBank subscriber 70% are choosing iPhone. In tablets also on a trend towards popularization, iPhone, some experts in Japan in terms of mobile phone never believes in iPhone, because there is no pictogram, no TVs. So there are much of criticism that they believed that iPhone will never sell in Japanese market. But I believe that was not true at all. At the time, I saw several articles with the signature, so maybe you can look back and regret what they \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what you said. But you see that the great sales in iPhone right now and the tablets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I believe in tablets, PC is already old machine, sometime soon that the tablets will be the mainstream. And you see the iPad, it's taking the number one position in terms of tablets sold in Japan. So that's why I say iPhone and iPad keep \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are taking the number one position. I myself also use both iPhone and iPad. I think it is good or best to have both. iCloud will be available sometime from this fall. So iCloud, iOS 5 is coming to be launched, and then those pictures you take in iPhone then that will automatically uploaded to iCloud, and that can be synchronized to iPad that you have. So any pictures that you take in iPhone, you'll be able to see in the bigger picture in iPad display, so, several things that you make an action in iPad that will be synchronized to iPad through iCloud. Cloud was already there. And there are several synchronized functions. However, what is great about Apple product is that not only Cloud is there, but also they become \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they sit in the users' position to make sure that its user friendly. And users don't have to read the manuals from the top to the end, and make operations step-by-step, but it's intuitive, simple and beautiful way that they provide such service. So seeing the launch of iCloud and also the launch of iOS 5, I think you'll never be able to make full advantage of iPhone and iPad. So if you have only one iPhone or only iPad then you'll never be able to enjoy fully. Of course, not only iPhone and iPad, but SoftBank will provide the rich line up to mature lifestyle, but still iPad and iPhone will become \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will be the main stream for more product line up. So year sometimes 2001 X, we're expecting to exceed 40 million subscribers. Most of the time I made a commitment, I always achieve. I don't remember the time that I didn't achieve. So think that I said let's do it, I'm always committed to make that happen. Forecast \\xe2\\x80\\x93 business forecast as well. Once that we made a forecast I never failed to achieve that. I don't recall any time of such. So, for example, net interest bearing debt reduction or in terms of net income or in any other items that I made a commitment, most of the cases we're told that we never were able to do that. But as far as I remember, most of the case I've been making that happen and achieved. That's how I see myself, and I believe in my words. So, 40 million subscribers or more within \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by 2020 is the direction and commitment that I am making. And also to increase CapEx \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to lay the foundation for further growth, we're increasing the CapEx. There are several complaints, claims that we need to have a more good coverage, maybe not renewable energy, but accessibility or network. There most of the customers' voice that we've been seeing on Twitter that the network or the coverage should be focused more. So to answer to that request, I am planning to make \\xc2\\xa51 trillion CapEx in two years. Last year already we made twice as much of the CapEx because we've been receiving the complaints and comments from the customers on several occasion. We made \\xc2\\xa5400 billion CapEx which was double the number of the previous year. And this year once again that we're going to increase CapEx to \\xc2\\xa5500 billion each for this fiscal and the next fiscal year, so that we'll be able to provide better coverage to the customers. So maybe in 10 years, some years later you may recall that the SoftBank did not provide the better quality of the network and -- but -- by then I believe that we'll be able to achieve that, and that's something that I definitely have to make it happen. So that is why that we are spending this CapEx. In terms of numbers, under our survey, DOCOMO you're seeing 1% of the out-of-coverage in residential area. In our case, it's 2%. So twice as much of customers are not able to be covered with network in their home, but in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in other words, 99% of the customers are available with the coverage in their home, and in our case, it's 98% of the customers have an access to our network in their homes. So only 1% to make it improved. So to make the 98% to 99% actually we're making twice as much of the CapEx so that we can provide a better coverage to those customers. So this is 1% is the kind of a key that we're making this CapEx. If you see the textbook of the business school, it's not very good investment return, but the figure is not everything. Sometimes that I have to do everything to make user happy and satisfied with the service so to make this 98% to 99% of the coverage at their home or their residential area that we're making this big spending. So I said \\xc2\\xa52 trillion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in two years in CapEx in sometime year later. So before it enters to 2020, maybe earlier as much as possible, we would like to achieve \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in operating income. DOCOMO is hitting about \\xc2\\xa5800 billion in the operating income, KDDI about \\xc2\\xa5400 some-billion. In our case, \\xc2\\xa5600 some-billion and within some years that we would like to bring that up to \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, which is higher than DOCOMO's operating income. So that's the kind of continuous effort that we would like to make. As on the comparison, DOCOMO's operating income in past five years is about flat and same as KDDI. Under such circumstance, SoftBank has been making progress and aiming at \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in some years. So within 10 years, or within less than 10 years that we would like to make that happen, so up until here was the business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 domestic business and from now on that I would like to talk about to become number in Asia in the Internet. The other day, there was discussion about Alipay and we may \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there are questions from shareholder that we don't \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don't get along with Jack Ma, but we made a big hug with Jack. That was the time of AGM, so negotiations making a constructive progress to solve issues in a timely manner. And next one is the largest real name SNS in China, Renren, something equivalent to Facebook. So this is a social network service, and achieving overwhelming number one in the market. And the SoftBank is the major shareholder of this company, 30% some right now. And the number of users exceeded 120 million, continuously growing. And this company set up the joint venture with Recruit for social wedding service launched in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to be launched in China. Renren Connect; this is our Renren equivalent of Facebook Connect and so far over 800 websites adopted this and platform is expanding sharply and rapidly. And number one online TV in China, PPLive which has more than 100 million monthly active users and the number is still increasing. The company has not been listed yet, but the profit is increasing. And Xinhua News Agency, which is like NHK of Japan, the state-owned news agency which \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Xinhua and PPTV will form business tie-up. They will provide technical support and content. So Xinhua Online Platform will be built by the two companies. Also the Korean number one TV station, KBS and number two TV station MBC will give exclusive distribution of Korean content to PPTV. In China, Korean TV shows or so-called K-Pop are very popular and PPTV received exclusive distribution right of the top Korean content. One example \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one interesting example is this. Happy Girl Reality Show; this is like a beauty pageant, or popular \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there are lot of categories like popular female singers. And this program will be available for 24 hours and contestants \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the program the contestants will live together in one place and the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what they do in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will be broadcast through the PPTV program. So what's the SoftBank true identity? Look at these graphs, Group A on the one side and Group B on the other side. Group A, what kind of companies are in Group A and what kind of companies are in Group B. Group A is about Internet companies and this is about EBITDA. In western world, the EBITDA is one of the key performance index. And SoftBank is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 SoftBank's EBITDA growth rate is comparable to Google for the past six years. Now, in Japan, the operating income is one of the key performance index and NTT DOCOMO and KDDI are recording flat operating profit, but SoftBank recorded sharp increase. And so judging from these graphs, which group SoftBank belongs? As judging from the curve of the line, the SoftBank should be part of the Group A because the line is very similar to the Google's. In Group B the SoftBank's curve is not similar to NTT DOCOMO and KDDI. Again in United States and Europe, EBITDA is one of the measurement of company's profitability. EBITDA multiple explains the growth rate of EBITDA. That's what EBITDA multiple is for. So EBITDA times growth rate, that's how we can get EBITDA multiple. So in terms of EBITDA, we are close to Internet companies. But in terms of EBITDA multiples, we are not like other Internet companies because in this table we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our EBITDA multiple is just 3.8 times, but all others are more than two digit. So our EBITDA multiple is quite similar to mobile companies or telecom companies. But again when we acquired Vodafone K.K., I said at the press conference that, please don't call us a telecom company. Our ambition is not that small, that's what I said in a press conference. Comparing to telecom company is not appropriate. Well, I don't mean to be rude, but I wanted to increase the EBITDA to the level of Internet companies because SoftBank is pursuing a new business model. So profits should grow like Internet companies and EBITDA multiple should grow like other Internet companies. And if that happened, then our enterprise value would increase sharply. But as of today, in stock market, or in the public as a whole, in general, this formula is not well perceived yet. But maybe in 15 years time or 20 years time that formula will be well understood. So is SoftBank a mobile company or an Internet company? Which is the right description? Actually, my answer is it's not mobile or Internet, but the answer is mobile company and Internet company, because SoftBank is a new \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is pursuing new business model. So it's a combination of a mobile company and Internet company. So this right-hand \\xe2\\x80\\x93 left-hand side shows a list of mobile companies. So we are part of the mobile company group, but we are also part of the Internet companies group. We are somewhere between in having the characteristics of both mobile companies and Internet companies. So that's why we are pursuing mobile Internet company, which is first of its kind in the world and that's what SoftBank is for. Just for your information, is Apple a hardware company or Internet company? Well, Apple is not engaged in manufacturing. iPhone and iPad are not produced by Apple in Apple's factories. But some people believe Apple is a hardware company, but the company doesn't own factory to produce hardware. But Apple provides iTunes or iCloud service. So in that sense, Apple is an Internet company. So Apple is a hardware company and Internet company, because Apple is providing platform company, which is selling Internet machine. So Apple is hardware and Internet company. And SoftBank is a company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's just running mobile company and Internet company. It's new. So SoftBank is providing mobile platform, and under its umbrella it has 900 Internet companies as a portfolio. So \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or in other words, SoftBank is Internet company group and SoftBank owns shares of those companies. So SoftBank's 900 Internet companies and SoftBank owns mobile platform. So we are striving to become number one mobile Internet company in the world, which is a new, totally new in the world. And this is our core business and we will fulfill our commitments in our core business. Of course, we want to play a part in addressing national crisis. So in that sense, the renewable energy initiative is just part of contribution we can do to address the national health. But again, our core business is our mobile Internet business. Of course, I'm aware that the customers are complaining about coverage or connectivity, but we will \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are determined to address that. Just give us some time. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your attention.\",\n",
       " '2011 Q2': \"I am Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank. There has so many things happened this year. In March, we had Great East Japan Earthquake and also, just recently, which was very sad news, Mr. Steve Jobs, who is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who I admired a lot has just passed away. His accomplishment, I think I don't have to speak about it, but when I was in U.S. when I was a teenager, Steve just introduced Apple II at that time. And I saw that at the exhibitions, and I was so impressed with that product. And I remember that as if it happened yesterday. Just the general public was able to start experiencing PCs. If he was not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if he was not here, I believe that the PC world is totally different thing. So, I think that was a great accomplishment that he made. And also, fortunately we were able to build a great friendship with him and we were able to have a joint project together with his company for a few years. And I have a great chance to meet him several times. And it was a very much honor for me to be able to have such great opportunity to have a close relationship with him. And it was a great memory of mine too, and very sorry to learn that he is not here in this world anymore. But at the same time, we are in the middle of evolutions of this technology, and I hope that we'll be able to bring more happiness to people with new products and services. Now that I would like to go into my presentation. Three years ago, we had experienced the Lehman shock. Even now that there are lots of financial crisis in European countries and others, but at the time of Lehman shock, there was rumors that the SoftBank might bankrupt, and it was covered by lots of media. And even the close friends of mine asked me that whether SoftBank is okay. During that time, to answer those questions to the investors and the analysts of the securities companies, we made a commitment to reduce the net interest-bearing debt to half in three years. Originally it was \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion and bring it down to half. And this is one commitment and we made three commitments. The first commitment was to answer the concerns about the big debt that we have. And we made a commitment to reduce that down to half in three years. At the time, I mentioned that, that the people said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or people doubted at us that we'll never be able to achieve such a commitment. And people also mentioned that there is a big mouth of us. However, as a matter of fact that we were able to accomplish this target before spending three years, so we bring it down to \\xc2\\xa50.7 trillion of the net interest-bearing debt. And the second commitment we made was to achieve the free cash flow to a certain reasonable level and at the same time to reduce the net interest-bearing debt so that the second commitment was to record \\xc2\\xa51 trillion free cash flow in three years. They were also told that that is close to impossible but, as a matter of fact, again we were able to achieve this target before spending three years. And the third commitment was about operating income. So, to achieving the commitment for the free cash flow, we made a commitment over the consolidated operating income. At that time, we made a commitment over the two years ahead of the operating income, which was rare things. We were able to achieve this. And also, we exceeded the target lines of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 committed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 consolidated operating income. So, as a matter of fact that we achieved the commitment for three consecutive years, and at the same time, we accelerated our business plans. So, in the past three years, we're spending such accumulations so that we were able to double the size of the consolidated operating income in three years from \\xc2\\xa5180 billion to \\xc2\\xa5373 billion, so two times in three years. It's easy to say, but it's always difficult to actually accomplish. And the comparison with the other companies, in three years, seeing the absolute numbers in the listed companies, we were the number one domestically. So all the listed companies in Japan, comparing with those companies, in three years, the absolute figures of the increment of the operating income, we were number one. At the time of Lehman shock three years ago, actually we were told that either JAL, Japan Airlines or SoftBank that may bankrupt. And as a matter of fact, we were the one that made the biggest increment of the operating income in three years. And on the other hand the Japan Airline which was told that it may be better than SoftBank back then, but they went into the bankrupt. So, we believe that we were able to achieve such commitment. So, everything that we said has been turning out as a truth, and I'm happy to report that. We're now going to the consolidated earnings results highlights. Net income 2.8 times year-on-year basis, \\xc2\\xa5217.2 billion. In operating income, \\xc2\\xa5373.2 billion, 18% increase year-on-year basis, a record high for six consecutive periods. Consolidated net sales; as you can see on the slide, EBITDA in the European and U.S. countries is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the accounting rule is a little bit different. So, that's why that we have this EBITDA as one of the major index to show our business result. And this has also showed the 16% increase. Operating income, as I mentioned earlier, it was the 18% increase. But if you look back for about six to seven years ago, we were just turning out from the red ink. And after then, we're making a steady increase in every year basis. And now, record high for six consecutive periods. And now, ordinary income increased by 24%. In net income, 2.8 times year-over-year. Free cash flow, record high for three consecutive periods to \\xc2\\xa5235 billion. In net interest-bearing debt over EBITDA multiple, because people may say that net interest-bearing debt is still large, but the important index is that not only the net interest-bearing debt which we are reducing in steady basis, but at the same time we have to have the profit to repay that debt. And we have to show the increments of the EBITDA to earn the profit to repay such debt. Then that should be the reasonable lines for the business point of view. And now that we're making a great pace of the EBITDA growth, at the same time reducing the net interest-bearing debt, and this multiple is less than 1 times now. So, I believe this is one of the index for the healthy management, and we are now showing the less than 1 times of the net interest-bearing debt of EBITDA multiple. Comparing with the other companies, and those are the companies which is under the great situation of the business, Panasonic, KDDI, NTT, Toshiba, Sharp, Hitachi, those companies are around 1 times or 2 times. So they have such interest-bearing debt. But as a matter of fact that we're making a well-balanced situation for net interest-bearing debt over EBITDA in multiple. So, people may say that the SoftBank has huge debt, but this is just an image from the past. And that's something that I would like to emphasize once again, because sometimes even now in news, in newspapers, in magazines, or some tweeters saying that we are in a huge debt, but that's a misunderstanding. That's just an image from the past and that image has to be revised this time. So, you see those great companies in comparison with this multiple that we're in a better position, as a matter of fact. So, at the time of the peak of the net interest-bearing debt was \\xc2\\xa52.4 trillion when we acquired Vodafone. And we had spent about \\xc2\\xa52 trillion for the acquisition. So, it was a kind of a stretched loan or borrowings that we made; high leveraged. However, although we have such concerns, but we were able to repay in a great speed. And now that brings it down to the very healthy balance of the debt right now. Three years from now, which is 2014, fiscal year 2014, we are expecting to bring this down to zero. And as you can see that this commitment is unchanged, and we're on track of reducing this debt. In the summary of the consolidated earnings results shown as on the slide, you see all indexes are in a good position. Comparison with the competitors in terms of consolidated EBITDA, DOCOMO, hasn't announced the first half of the earnings result yet. So, we don't know, but most of that is forecasted. About the flat growth in DOCOMO's consolidated EBITDA; for the past five to six years, they've been in a flat situation, but we were making quite a steady increase. Next, consolidated operating income. As you can see, our number was about 1.5 times as much as KDDI. At the current pace, we would surpass the NTT DOCOMO in a few years and we are determined to surpass NTT DOCOMO. It's free to say something about the company's determination. But actually, whenever we promise something, we always deliver that. Please remember that. And also, many people would say that we are a debt-ridden company. So even if we generate income, we need to pay interest. So, our net income is always small. Our net income would be closer to NTT DOCOMO's. It's just a matter of time. And the driving force of our income is Mobile Communications business net addition was like this for the past six months and WILLCOM would become part of our group. And in the past five years, our group's accumulative subscribers doubled in the last five years. Our number has been increasing steadily for the past five years. Now, consolidated net sales increased by 5%. Now, in Mobile Communications business, the telecom revenue grew by 14% year-on-year. Let me refresh your memory. In the history of SoftBank, we acquired Vodafone which seemed to be the most risky project. Now these bars in the graph show the income earned by Vodafone. And as you can see, the operating income fell every year. And in the middle of falling income, we decided to acquire that company. But after our acquisition, the Mobile Communications business made a great turnaround, V-shaped recovery in operating income. And if we had shown this graph back in five, six years ago, 99% or more people would say that this graph is impossible, Mr. Son might be a con-artist, this graph may not be possible. I guess 99% of the people who might have seen this graph five or six years ago would say so. And even internally \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in an internal meeting, a lot of people said this plan of income growth seems to be impossible. But actually, the Mobile Communications business grew more than expected. We had this picture at the time of our acquisition of Mobile Communications business, but actually, we achieved that. In this term, Mobile Communications business operating income grew 21% year-on-year and Mobile Communications business operating income surpassed KDDI's for the first time. Until the last term, we surpassed KDDI in terms of consolidated operating income. But this time, in Mobile Communications business only, we surpassed KDDI for the first time. We are proud of that. Now, WILLCOM. For WILLCOM, nobody seems to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 wants to help the company. When the company was in trouble, do you remember who was the previous owner of the WILLCOM? Anyway, nobody wanted to offer helping hand to the company. And WILLCOM lost users every year before we extended helping hand. WILLCOM recorded net loss every term, but SoftBank wanted to increase the number of base stations. And so, even if we will suffer loss because of helping WILLCOM, we had to help WILLCOM so that we could use the base station of WILLCOM. But once WILLCOM became part of our Group, everything turned around. WILLCOM started to record net addition, and the number is increasing since then. And in the second quarter, the company recorded operating income. The company was back in the black. The court said that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I'm sorry, when we applied for helping WILLCOM, we said to the court that we may need to lay off half of the WILLCOM employees in order to keep the company alive. And the court agreed that maybe we may need to lay off half of the employee. But actually, we didn't fire any one of WILLCOM's employee, and right now WILLCOM is turning around. It recorded net addition, and right now, morale of the WILLCOM employees are high \\xe2\\x80\\x93 running high once the WILLCOM has become a part of SoftBank Group. The morale of the WILLCOM employees are running high. Now, our telecom revenue grew 14%. Now let's compare that with other companies in the world. The two operators in Japan recorded negative growth, but our growth rate is number one in the world. Japan market is already mature. And SoftBank acquired Vodafone, which was losing income but we acquired Vodafone's mobile communications business in this mature market. But \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and also WILLCOM \\xe2\\x80\\x93 WILLCOM was losing customers, but once it becomes part of the Group, then the company is turning around. Our operating income gross rate is 21%, which is by far the highest in the world. Even in the emerging nations where the market is still growing, the operator like China Mobile, their operating income grew just 2%. And Verizon in the U.S., their operating income grew just 0.3%. And America Movil, an operator in Latin America where the market is still growing, their operating income gross rate is negative. In markets that is not mature, the gross is given, but actually this is not the case. Now, how can we increase the market cap multiple? Well, we should increase operating income. In emerging markets with growing mobile phone market, their operators are struggling to increase their operating income, but SoftBank achieved positive growth rate in terms of operating income. Even though Japanese market is mature, it's really hard. It's tough, but we achieved that and we are number one. Now, the Skype, Google Voice has appeared. So if we are too much dependent on voice communication revenue, that will be risky. So, we are shifting our focus to data communication revenue. And our data ARPU ratio is number one in the world. Our net sell growth rate is number one. Operating income growth rate is number one, and we are the quickest to shift to the data communication focus in the world. So that's what's happening in the past six months. But having said that, KDDI joined SoftBank to sell iPhone in Japan. SoftBank is not the sole iPhone provider anymore. So, can SoftBank continue to grow? Most of the people in this room have this question. So, I'd like to answer your question without any excuse. I definitely grow this business. I always beat odds. I always succeed in growing the business even in a difficult situation. Maybe you take it as a talk or big mouth, but I don't care. I definitely make the company continue to grow. Look at this picture. In a mass electronic retailer in Akihabara, we ran a survey of customers. We asked which iPhone are you going to buy, AU's iPhone or a SoftBank's iPhone? AU is on the right hand side. And I was terrified by this result, because AU \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 much, much more people voted for AU. I was terrified by this result. And this is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually our sales team ran this survey and when I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my sales team reported the results, I was a bit shocked. I thought that a lot of people would cancel our contract. We worked tirelessly for the past years to acquire customers, acquire iPhone users but they would cancel their contracts and switch to AU. We have to be ready for that. So this could be biggest dangers after our entering of this market. So we seriously consider and seriously study how we can counter the situations and we had intensive discussion with our management. And as a result, this is my true \\xe2\\x80\\x93 honest feeling. It is as if the fog has cleared. In the past few years, every time when we have this earnings results announcement, I have a question \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I received a question that the people say to me that congratulations on a great results on operating income. There is nothing that I should comment about. However, it's always up to iPhone, right? That's the question that I often receive. Because we have a solo provider of iPhone so that is why that you have a great result, and if you lose this sole provider status for the iPhone, then you'll not be able to keep that momentum. That's the kind of a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 maybe wish of yours, I don't know, but that's the question that I received often every time. But my answer for those questions is that that there is no such exclusivity on a contract to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for being the sole provider in the market. So that's the comment that I've been making from the beginning. But there is nothing more to say for me in my head. I always thought that if we will not be the only provider, how many of the users will go for the churn. So that's the kind of the simulation that we've been making. And we've been concerned within concerned over this risk. Past results, of course, there were clear nice results. However, if we will not become the only provider, then what happened? That's the kind of the fog in my head, but that thought has been cleared, as a matter of fact. That's the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's the honest feeling of mine right now. Because as you can see in the previous slide as far \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as much as you see, it's not really the fog but seems like it's the disaster or it could be a storm coming over to our way. However, as a matter of fact, once that we launch the program, there is no such storm, there is no such fog, but it's all cleared away. And this is because we have this launch day for iPhone 4S and we started receiving pre-orders and start selling the iPhone 4S and we received the record high preorders numbers. We thought probably we will need to expect 20% to 30% increase over to the iPhone 4, because KDDI became one of the channel for the iPhone 4S, which is not a good news for us, but still, we believe that we can increase the number of sales by 20% to 30%, so that's how we design our system to receive such pre-orders. But as a matter of fact, it was not only 20% to 30%, but some 100% increase, much higher than we expected. That is why that we had to go through this system trouble, we are very sorry about that situation. I know that we made you very inconvenient situation for the time of sales of iPhone in our information system department. Dealers has to go through my angers of such situation, but because we were no longer the only providers of this iPhone product, so that we thought that probably 20% to 30% will be the kind of the increase in sales of the iPhone. But that was not something that we not expected. It became some hundreds of the increase, 100% of increase, which was not expected by us, not by KDDI nor Apple. And all inventories are gone and actually, even now that we're out of inventories and we've been in such situations for several days after the launch. So as a result, there are some churns, of course, after this launch, but that's something that happens in the competitors as well. But it was not like tremendous numbers of churn like it was expected before the launch of this product. And we thought that we may have to confront the several million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sorry, the delivery of the million levels of the churn, however, that was unnecessary consideration. There was no such tremendous number of churn by such situations of clearly they're joining to the other providers of the iPhone 4S. And now what's happening \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you'll see that there is two iPhones. It seems like identical twins. SoftBank version of iPhone 4S and the new version of iPhone 4S. So only from the outside exterior, you'll never be able to tell which is which just as identical twins. And I believe that the most of you feel that way. Any of you in this venue that knows about the difference of the details of the specification? If you have any confidence that you can tell each detail of the difference of those two version of iPhone, there is not only one or two but there are so many difference of the specification of those two version at the content. And if you know so, please raise your hand. In this venue, if you are the holder of iPhone 4S, please raise your hand. Only two or three people. So most of you have never experienced iPhone 4S. That is why that you can never tell the difference because you don't have it now, so that's why you don't know the difference. And we didn't expect the large number of churn in the beginning of the launch, but gradually I believe that the many more people start using those two different iPhone 4S, then that you will become the person that knows the difference. So once that this becomes popular, then I believe more and more people start knowing the difference because inside it's totally different. These are only few of those differences. Exterior is exactly the same, but interior, it's totally different. And also specification for the communication is different, function is different. I'm not going to pick one by one. That will give me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will be a long time to go through and maybe you don't want to hear each in details, but this is something that starts realizing the difference of those two devices. Then that the people will realize that which one is more friendly to the users in terms of, for example, messaging, and we had a kind of a good of start in the launch and now that we will be having receiving the true evaluation on our own iPhones. So with our momentum, and we're keeping the momentum in terms of net additions and also the profit. And there are many people say that that is only because iPhone. But once again I'd like to show you the fact so those right-hand side from the black lines are the months that we start selling iPhone. On your left-hand side, those before iPhone launch. The SoftBank net addition is number one, stat recording before iPhone launch we've been already the number one on net additions. There are so many saying that they're not good brand or not good coverage under such circumstances. As a matter of fact, that we've been recording number one position in net additions for about over a year ago of the time of iPhone launch. So as a culture of the SoftBank, without any excuses, that we would like to keep on working with this momentum, but at the same time, we have one hurdle to tackle which is a coverage issue. If the great functions in iPhone 4S and the difference with those iPhone 4S of new version, but many people tell me that still coverage is weak. I admit that, up until now, the coverage of SoftBank has been in difficulty. It was even worse, but then in the Vodafone era, and I admit that their coverage was not good enough. And I admit that that is why that we've been putting in every effort to improve that because we admit that. So that is why that we can put an effort to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and how much effort that we've been making if that you can see from the number of base stations because at the time of acquisition of Vodafone, the Vodafone management told me that the weight had enough numbers of base stations. We only need 10% or 20% on addition to that. But then that we didn't have all knowledge about the mobile phone market. But after then, we realized that those numbers of base stations were not enough to cover the service. So we have increased the number of base stations eight times in five periods, especially last year that we made a network enhancement initiative in SoftBank and we increased the number of base stations rapidly. We've said we've been able to improve the connection ratio at home compared to the last during March. And now, about 99% of the coverage is provided at the residential area. So we improved to the par level. A year ago it was not like this, but now that we turned around and made a better improvement in the coverage ratio at home. And when it comes to the overall ratio, not only the residential area, we've been making the connection ratios are based every week basis not only to SoftBank also, but to the competitor. Year ago, it was not satisfactory level, but spending year, we've been able to improve that catching up to the competitors. But I'm not satisfied yet, but this is the substitute surveys for the several thousand, tens of thousands of people and customers. In addition to this improvement, we also increased the number of Wi-Fi access points, because we need to offload the traffic through this Wi-Fi, because we not only SoftBank but all three carriers are experiencing the congestion in the network with this high traffic. And we've been working on to increase the number of Wi-Fi access points, and that's reaching 225,000 points. And starting from 1 November, we would be able to provide the Wi-Fi access to the Tokyo Metro Stations. So from the 1 of November, in every station in the Tokyo Metro Network, if you are SoftBank users, your phone will be able to access Wi-Fi network free of charge. On top of that, well, in suburban areas or especially mountainous area or hot spring resorts far away from metropolitan areas, the connectivity is not very good. That's what SoftBank users say. And so far, our competitors are given 800 megahertz golden spectrum. We are the only one operator without golden spectrum, but we are preparing for application for the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for getting license for $900 million megahertz bandwidth. We \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually KDDI and NTT ask for both 900 megahertz and 700 megahertz. But we just focus on our efforts to obtain 900 megahertz spectrum on the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if we were not be able to obtain the license, then that's not in the best interest of SoftBank's users. Because among the smartphone users in Japan, the SoftBank users account for the most share, and smartphone takes 10 to 20 times as much data traffic. And so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but out of the smartphone users in Japan, the SoftBank users account for the biggest share, but SoftBank users cannot be able to use the good connectivity. And so if \\xe2\\x80\\x93 although we were not granted 900 megahertz license, then that would cause a great inconvenience to SoftBank users. So I'm \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we are determined to obtain the 900 megahertz. And we were granted the license then we could launch the service. In summer next year, and so far our networks were not reliable, many people said. And so to address that complaint, we were working on building as many base stations as possible. But on top of that effort, if we were to obtain the license for 900 megahertz, then our coverage will be better than what our competitors can provide in most of the areas in Japan. Maybe some areas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in some areas, we were \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our coverage may not be better than what competitors can offer, but in other areas, our coverage could be better than what competitors can offer in summer next year. And by the end of next year, next fiscal year, we will be better than competitors in terms of coverage if we were granted the license for 900 megahertz bandwidth. But again, I'm determined to obtain the license and also, I strongly believe that we are planted the license. So, we already set aside the budget for CapEx, \\xc2\\xa51 trillion for this year and next year and we procured the fund for that purpose already. Now, network coverage and iPhone spec difference aside, what is our plan for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the mid and long-term period? We are confident about further growth. So what \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how do you define SoftBank? SoftBank is not a telecom operator. Actually, SoftBank never was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was never the telecom operator. I am the owner of the company, but I was not and will not be the telecom company present. I acquired \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our company acquired a mobile phone business, but that was not because we were aiming to be the telecom company. We are aiming to be the internet company. We have 900 Internet companies in our Group. It's not just 20 or 30 companies. At the start of Internet, we believe in the Internet business, but we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that's why we started acquiring or investing in Internet companies. And that's why we have 900 companies in our Group. So we are determined to make Internet revolution happening. And right now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so we are ahead of the times. Well, in the age of 2G network, the mobile phone is just for voice communication but then the age of 3G came and we are moving towards 4G network age. Well the voice \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if the voice communication will not increase the traffic even though the number of users increased, but data communication traffic is growing. Please remember what happened 10 years ago, the mobile phones with looks like that and CPU speed was 30 DMIPS and LCD communication speed was like these. But what we have now today is like this. CPU's capability is about 250 times fast and LCD 15 times clearer or sharper and speed increased by 650 times. That's a tremendous change in just 10 years. Let's think about the car engines capability or capacity change in the past 10 years, their engine \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the car engine speed didn't increase two times in the past 10 years, but the CPU's capability increased more than 200 times and communication speed increased 650 times. Why did that happen? Actually, six years ago, I said that in 10 years time that we'll see the faster and better processor and communication speed. And by then, the mobile phone would be at the center of Internet world. And that's why we decided to acquire Vodafone's Mobile Communication business. Now 10 years ago, the i-mode was hugely popular and a lot of people believe that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the people can access to the Internet using i-mode but actually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but the people back then misunderstood or mistaken i-mode as an internet. Even in the dominant agency's white paper, there was a statement to the effect that i-mode will give people internet access, but actually that was not true. And also the [ph] auEZ (55:00) web service, that is not the internet. It was like AOL said that the service provided by AOL represent a whole world of internet, but actually that is wrong. And back then, 10 years ago, the people believed that i-mode was equal to Internet, but actually that was wrong. In the next 10 years, the real Internet machine became part of our daily lives. And in the real Internet world, the number of applications available on the mobile handsets is 800,000, which is about 400,000 times as much as what was available on the i-mode. Just 10 years ago, only 200 applications were available, and people paid \\xc2\\xa5100 per month to check out weather forecast. And so the people kept paying \\xc2\\xa5100 or more for applications for the weather forecast or things like that. And once the user signs up for the weather forecast service, they \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unless they cancel that application service, they had to pay \\xc2\\xa5100 or \\xc2\\xa5200 every month. Anyway, in this real world of Internet and the smartphone, it's proliferating, the paradigm shift took place. Smartphone and tablets; those are the real Internet machine, i-mode is not an Internet machine. So, the age of real Internet machine would come, that's what I said six years ago. And we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our company made a management decision to acquire the license to do the business of mobile communication. And why we made that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why did we made that decision? Because we were confident that the real Internet world would come in five years time back end. And to provide the real Internet service, we needed the real or authentic OS. Japanese manufacturers developed their own OS or on their own to make \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or they developed their software in-house to provide services through mobile phones or mobile handsets. But that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such mobile phone or mobile handsets could not be usable in the real Internet world. But Steve Jobs, I didn't buy that idea, and that's why he developed the OS for real Internet machine. And the only person in the world who asked Steve Jobs to create the mobile handset with real authentic Internet operating system capable of Internet, who is that person? That's me. I drafted a drawing for the smartphone. And I showed that drawing to Steve Jobs, so SoftBank believed in the Internet world even many, many years ago before people started adopting and embracing idea of Internet. And that's why I believe that in 10 years about 2010 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2020, their smartphone share will be about 90%. Just a few years ago, many people said in Japan that smartphone will not sell well, because smartphone cannot handle infrared communications or smartphone cannot be used as an e-wallet, a lot of experts said so. I have this here now, so those who said wrong comments, I would like those people to correct your message. I believe that there are some people here in this venue as well that made such comment. So, people said that we'll not be able to sell, but as a matter of fact that they have no doubt at this time or this era will come. So that is why that we've been making and introducing several initiatives and we will keep doing that. Not only for the smartphone but also the tablet era will exceed the PC. And probably PC will be only for the experts, but the mainstream will be occupied by tablets. That's the kind of the time that I am expecting and I have no doubt about it. So, not only iPhone. As a matter of fact about three years ago from now, we've been asking those vendors we have a relationship to only bring smartphones, because we have no interest over those phones other than smartphones. That's a strong message. And I was the only one that's conveying such message to the vendors. Even internal employees or internal staff said that I had made two extreme comments, because this is not something that you can do over a day or month, but it takes time. And now that the ratio of smartphone amount is 92%, that is only SoftBank. I mentioned that we have three number ones in the world, incremental profit and the data ratio is number one; two, and also the net addition. Is this just a coincidence or is this something that we planned to become such number ones in three categories? I don't believe that the coincidence can continue like that long. It's not that easy that you can win the market with coincidence. You'll never be able to continue the great results with coincidence. Everyone is putting every effort to win this market; every mobile operators, every CEOs, managements are putting every effort. And taking the number one position amongst such competition continuously is not that easy as you can tell. And people may say that SoftBank had iPhone that is why, but iPhone has been sold in hundred some countries in the world. That's also another fact. SoftBank was not only the operator selling the iPhone, there are hundred and some countries selling this product. And we're keeping this number one position continuously. So that is another fact that I would like to emphasize once again. That's how we've been designed. Our business; and we have that confident and also belief in our initiatives, and also shifted our management resource to accomplish this goal. So that's a culture of the SoftBank, and also hit the directions. And we have to have such operations and preparations for all that, otherwise we'll never be able to gain such results. Data ARPU is increasing every year basis and along with that we're increasing the total ARPU as well. So, we would like to make another evolution for the Internet company. I've mentioned earlier that we have over 900 Internet companies also in the Group. That is why that we can have another step towards the evolutions as an Internet company. We see integrated service with those group companies. And we can foresee what happens in three years, five years and 10 years and we would be able to be confident with such evolutions and our forecast. And then one thing that I can tell you as an example. Alibaba Group about one month ago, this as a private placement, because this is not listed yet, this company sold its shares to the existing shareholders and employees. And there were so much offers. And at the time, the transactions for this Group was \\xc2\\xa52.7 trillion. Did you know about this fact that the \\xc2\\xa52.7 trillion was a transition amount? Only 3% or so. 97% of people did not know about this fact. In Japan, this fact was not covered, almost nothing in the media. Even experts here, here we have analysts, journalists, people who know about the industry, who are experts on our SoftBank as well, and those who knows about that, but not about 97% of the people didn't know about the fact that the \\xc2\\xa52.7 trillion of market cap were assumed market value for this Alibaba Group. And for this Alibaba Group, we have about \\xc2\\xa5900 billion equivalent equity is held by SoftBank. So, 37% of the share our equity is owned by SoftBank. So it's just equivalent to about \\xc2\\xa5900 billion. And how much of this is reflected to our SoftBank share price? And as a matter of fact, it's not really -- nothing has been reflected to our share price of SoftBank. This transaction was made about a month ago or so in this \\xc2\\xa52.7 trillion not yet listed. B2B business has been listed but this Alibaba Group, the real meaning of this Alibaba Group is coming from Taobao. Taobao is the business that encouraged to Alibaba management to set up the C2C company in addition to B2B, which is Alibaba. And we offered for the investment of these joint ventures. And that's how the Taobao was established. And this Taobao is actually is the main driving force for the body of this Alibaba Group. Taobao is kind of the major stream for this Alibaba Group and the transaction was made under the assumed market value of \\xc2\\xa52.7 trillion. And you have a comparison with Amazon.com, which is already IPO'ed and \\xc2\\xa58 trillion and because Alibaba is not listed, so \\xc2\\xa53.7 trillion, but as a real business wise, Taobao has already recorded twice as much of shopping transaction volume compared to Amazon.com. And also, growing ratio is much higher than Amazon's. So, now that Taobao is the leading edge of this e-commerce business and this is held by Alibaba Group and which is not a listed company and one-third of this Alibaba Group is held by SoftBank. So that's another fact. Rakuten is the famous company in Japan for the e-commerce, but actually this company has a much bigger transaction than Rakuten. This is the last year's result, so they are making about every \\xe2\\x80\\x93 doubling the size every year basis. I'm not sure that they can double the figures for this year or not, but they have a momentum so they can keep a good trend. So Alibaba who holds 100% of Taobao and how much valuation will be made for this Alibaba Group if they go for public. And you can imagine that. And even on listed status, but still that equity is about \\xc2\\xa5900 billion equivalent, so if this... We have \\xc2\\xa5600 billion for the Yahoo! Japan and this \\xc2\\xa5600 billion and \\xc2\\xa5900 billion for this Alibaba Group, in sum of those two, we have \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion, only adding, simply adding those two that already gives us \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion and we have net interest bearing debt \\xc2\\xa5700 billion. So we can have twice as much of the amount only coming from Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Group. So we already have such amounts. So if we would like to clear all the debts right now, then that we will be able to do that only liquidating half of the shares we have for Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Group. So that's a kind of a status that we have and why do we need to worry about this that. This is not something that's on our balance sheet, with these figures of \\xc2\\xa5900 billion because only the invested amount is recorded on our balance sheet, which is about \\xc2\\xa530 billion, \\xc2\\xa530-some billion and now that's validated to \\xc2\\xa5900 billion. In addition to that, most of the people may not know about this, but we became the major shareholder of InMobi. InMobi, you may not know, but this is the company, which is one of the largest mobile network in the world. Unique number wise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unique user's number wise, it reaches to 340 million consumers using smartphone and tablets. And they have ad impressions of 47 billion per month with smartphone and tablets. So they are providing such service to the consumers in the world. And this is also making a great growth and we have already made $100 million as an initial investment. And we plan to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we do have a right to invest another $100 million next year. And we said that we will be the largest shareholder of this company. Users reached, as you can see on this graph, just about two years ago. There was almost none, but making a rapid growth in this past two years. So operators who has a subscriber can become only the pipelines as a business model, only falling into the price competitions. All the management of mobile operators in the world is fearing about this consideration that SoftBank has become more than pipe companies, but are now already trying to get the number one position in a variety of the area in relation to the mobile Internet, one of the biggest e-commerce on mobile and also number one in terms of reach of the customers for the mobile ad network. So this is something that becomes so-called smart advertisement on smartphones and tablets, so worldwide mobile ad market is going making a rapid increase. This graph is rather conservative from my understanding and I believe that that will give us even more growth. In addition to that, that to proceed further possibilities in mobile Internet that we would like to keep focusing on Asian market and set up that the joint ventures with party which is still one of the largest mobile operator in India. Look at this; well, the DOCOMO tie up with Tata in India, it's ranked sixth on this table. We don't have intention to tie up with both of these players. We tie up number one from tie up with number one player which is Bharti Airtel and we and Bharti Airtel established a joint venture. Why Bharti Airtel is important for us? Because mobile phone users in India will become the largest in the world in the next few years overtaking China, and Asia is the biggest mobile phone market in the world and the market is growing still and India is most notable. In Japan, the market is shrinking and population is aging but we have a strategy to continue to grow by forming a tie up with the good players in Asia and Bharti, which is number one player in India is our partner and Bharti and SoftBank formed a joint venture for incubation. The President of the Bharti Airtel, Mr. Sunil, he \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we get acquainted with each other. I met him five years ago, maybe, but we are close friends. And we discussed that we would establish a joint venture. So, Mr. Sunil and I agreed to establish a joint venture. So BSB Bharti SoftBank, this new company will do business in three areas, social media, games and e-commerce in India. So, SoftBank is not an Internet company with overnight success, but is actually SoftBank is a die-hard Internet believer. We have a long history of being involved in Internet business. Right now, the handset is transforming to be the Internet machine from the voice communication-only machine. We are ahead of the times. But right now, the society is catching up on us so fast and the mobile Internet will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 world will be in full bloom from now on. And in such \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in Asia, the Internet, we will be the most lively and energetic player in such a world. So, let me wrap up my presentation. Our company committed to increase the number of lines from current 30 million to 40 million before 2020 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 well before 2020 or the number of lines will be 14 million. It's a commitment. It's not just a goal or a target. In other words, if our company failed to deliver that commitment, then I would step down as the President. Next commitment is our company will top out companies. Consolidated operating income will top \\xc2\\xa51 trillion and not just one time, but generating cost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income many years. That's our commitment and we would achieve that commitment well before 2020. For the past five years, NTT DOCOMO generated about \\xc2\\xa5800 billion of operating income and the number has been leveling off \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the current rate, then we would surpass NTT DOCOMO. It's not our target, but it's my commitment as a President. The cloud, black cloud is overcasting SoftBank. Before the iPhone 4 is launched, we were not sure how many people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how many iPhone customers we could retain and prevent them from switching to KDDI. But right now, it's as if all the fogs cleared up. We are confident that our risks are manageable right now. So, considering that we are confident that we would generate \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of operating income on consolidated basis near future before 2020. And then with that income, we would cut our net interest-bearing debt to zero. Maybe keeping the net interest bearing zero for many years, may not be the best strategy, management wise. So, we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so, I'd say that at one time, sometime in the 2010, our net interest bearing debt will be zero. Again, having zero net interest bearing debt, it's not always a good thing for management. But I'd like to dispel all the concerns like the SoftBank is accessibly in debt. So that's all our \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these are our company's commitments and we will never change this commitment. And our management team are confident that we will fulfill these commitments. Now, one last question. Of mobile phone, mobile communication company, the SoftBank is number one in terms of income growth rate. Is it just one-time event? Almost all mobile communication companies were originated from telecom companies. What they believe in is that is coming from their management policies as telecom operators. But we are an Internet company. SoftBank is an Internet company and our policy is based on the Internet world. So which business model will be successful telecom company or Internet company and which one will be more successful in the future? What do you think? It's not just a matter of our quarterly income or new product lineup. Those would affect the income, but just within margin of error. What is important to manage the company is the management policy and visions. And we don't sway in terms of what we believe in, which is mobile Internet, and we are aiming to beat number one in mobile Internet world. Thank you very much for your kind attention. Now we'd like to open the floor for questions. If you have any questions, please raise your hands and wait for the microphone and please be in your question by stating your name and your affiliation.\",\n",
       " '2011 Q3': \"I am Son. Thank you very much for today. 1995: it was the time of the dawn of the Internet era. And it was right after the IPO of SoftBank. In that time, I was very much responsible for the profit and the management of the company. And right after the listing, I said that I wouldn't mind any of the profit at all of the company and even that we have to [indiscernible] (2:41), but still, we would like to put every effort into the Internet. And there was the announcement I made back then \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at that time I believe that most of the people didn't understand what I was trying to say, and our share price went straight down. But after then, Internet was recognized by the world, gradually and most of the share price of the Internet-related goes up. So [indiscernible] (3:21) search as our hero of the Internet. The peak was about 2000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 year 2000, and that time that we experienced burst of the bubble \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Internet bubble. And that time, again, I was almost criticized by all of the media and our share prices dropped again in the year. So, the people's evaluation can easily move up and down, but in the meantime, our company SoftBank has been focused on the Internet revolution, and we've been developing our business based on our concept, and that is becoming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are entering into a fruitful period. We are not ready yet to be defensive and try to be conservative, but we are very much offensive, and try to be aggressive. And this is the first time ever, since its foundation that I am going to announce officially our incomes forecast for the mid-term. So this is really the first time since our foundation to announce the operating income forecast, which is \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So, in the fiscal year 2016, we will like to aim for the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income. And that's the announcement that I will like to make today. And now, I'd like to explain the background, first of all, how are we going to make that achieve? So, that I would like to explain in my presentation. Japanese economy right now is really raining, or most of the companies experiencing the rate also experiencing the decline of the business. And also we are facing the confusion of the financial market in European countries. So now, I believe, we are going to make an announcement on the mid-term target and, also, I believe that this is the time that we should introduce initiative to do so. But our focus maintains Internet revolution, but now that we are able to provide the numerical target, and we are entering such period, I believe, as a company. So, in the beginning of the Internet or the dawn of the Internet, we didn't really talk about the income or profit, but we just put in our effort to develop. But now that [indiscernible] (6:21) period that we'd be able to have some numerical target. And now going to the details of the quarterly results, from April to December, which is a nine-month period, operating income recorded \\xc2\\xa5532.7 billion. This is record high for seven consecutive periods. And net income was \\xc2\\xa5250 billion and a 76% increase year-on-year basis. And [indiscernible] (6:51) to the detail, net sales, as we can see, is making a gradual and a steady increase. In European countries and the U.S., mostly EBIT is used as an key index and the EBITDA numbers of all companies, we have recorded 11% increase, \\xc2\\xa5776 billion operating income. This is rather a key index for Japanese market and \\xc2\\xa5532.7 billion was recorded, ordinary income \\xc2\\xa5443.9 billion. So, net interest-bearing debt has been reduced with our efforts. So, the operating income and the ordinary income numbers are becoming closer now. Net income here, 76% increase and \\xc2\\xa5250 billion. And this is the summary page. Net sales, compared with the competitors of ours and those two competitors we were able to grow in a bigger size. Operating income comparison with the competitors; DOCOMO, KDDI in past five to six years I believe that they've been experiencing the flat growth. Compared to that we'll be making a rapid growth here, and if you extend the line, I believe that you can easily imagine around the year 2016 reach the operating income of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. This is the figures here on the slide is the number from the first quarter to third quarter, but in a full-year basis there will be additionals to the \\xc2\\xa5532 billion, but sometime in the next year we aiming at \\xc2\\xa5700 billion in full year so that that will be path leading to the \\xc2\\xa51 billion of the operating income. Net income; we are the only operators, which made double-digit growth. Net income, \\xc2\\xa5250 billion; again, sometime near to future we are expecting to pass DOCOMO's line, and compared to those two, the growth of the net income we were the only operator, which made positive figure here. Operating cash flow also remains stable. Consolidated CapEx; the biggest and the only weak point we had is the coverage. And we too make a great improvement. We've been making aggressive CapEx so far and the cash flow is shown on this side. Net interest-bearing debt is also reducing dramatically. So, with that, we've been able to have a better review in rating and have upgraded. At the time of Lehman shock, we had \\xc2\\xa52 trillion net interest-bearing debt, and we made an announcement to bring at half in three years. So, in 2011, we will make it half, which is less than \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. And the most of people actually doubted about it and criticized, and that's something like a fraud to say something that not achievable. Or we were listed on the number of companies, which are about to bankrupt, and we are a very high level of ranking and being covered by the medias, magazines and those are famous analyst or the media commentators making that we are not possible to reduce the net interest-bearing debt. But actually we did what we have said and along with that we are able to see the upgrade and upgrade. So, the dividend per share, as we made an announcement that we're expecting to increase in 2014. And most of the biggest driving force of this operating income or the increasing income is this mobile communications business. So, five years, consecutive years that we've been number one for the subscriber net additions. Data ARPU also steadily increasing and I mentioned earlier about the income increase in overall consolidated basis but, more importantly, it's the telecom service revenue. Well, handset sales, is kind of a one-time revenue. But more important thing is the telecom service revenue from the customers. And this was record high and even more. We were able to record 13% increase here. 13% increase, I believe, is one of the biggest increase or growth, compared to the other telecom operators \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mobile operators in the rest of the world. Or probably if the operators located in small countries says a different story, but amongst most of the major mobile operator, I believe that our growth rate is one of the biggest. And in the domestic-wise, those two competitors in Japan are seeing negative figures here, and we are the only one showing this good figure. As a result, compared to the Vodafone Japan here, which is the red bars on your left, operating income was dropping, but after then that we had acquired this company, constantly we've been cumulating this operating income since then. On the mobile business operating income has already exceeded KDDI's operating income. The numbers that I mentioned earlier was the consolidated base, but if we only are looking at the mobile business, we have already exceeded the operating income of KDDI. And the Softbank's domestic ranking. Usually most of the media call us as the number three position in the industry. So, that's always, kind of, keyword, we are the number three in the market. But, I believe, we have mainly having a gift here from the economical perspective or the analysts of the security companies. So, that's probably income is even more important, compared to these sales. And the constant income is even more important, and that, I believe, is in more high interest on you. And from that sense of the SoftBank at least in operating income and net income has exceeded KDDI, and we are ranked in number two position, and also, the only weakness that we had, which is the coverage, when you go to the mountain area or the in between the buildings we had the difficulty of the reaching of the coverage. And to overcome that weak point, we had spent CapEx to improve the situation. And with that that we've been exceeding the amount of CapEx, compared to KDDI. With that I've been mentioning that our target for the fiscal year 2016, I believe for this full year basis is going to be \\xc2\\xa5600-some billion. But next year, we're quite sure that we are going to exceed \\xc2\\xa5700 billion in operating income. And based on that assumption we're expecting that we will be able to achieve the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income and I'll let to set the target date for that as a representative of the company. So, our target of operating \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our target operating income in fiscal 2016 is \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. A lot of hardware manufactures like automakers and electronic appliance makers are recording the sharp losses or, but that is not a one-time event in my view. Let's look at the history of society from the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 transformed from the agriculture-based society to industrial revolution and now, we are in the age of information, a paradigm shift. With the development of agriculture, the people are settled in the southern area and earned food for their survival. But then came industrial revolution, but revolution in industrialized society is at the last stage right now. Right now, the developed countries cannot stay in a dominant position over the emerging nation just relying on technology. Right now what is important is those countries with cheap labor with high technology, so that's why the developed countries are caught up by emerging nations. However, Apple, Google or Facebook, Amazon, all those companies are different. Those companies are driving American economy, and those companies are information company. And that's the global trend, and that will be the driving force of 21st century. And we are playing part in information society. And that's why we would like to establish ourselves as a information company with \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating profit. If we miss the target of 2016, just one year, that's just a margin of error from my viewpoint. What is more important for us is that to record operating income steadily at around the level of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. To achieve that we will like to execute two strategies; those are our basis for our company. First, one is enhance customer base and the other is to enhance network. So, let me tell you about the first strategy: to enhance the customer base. For the past five years, we were number one in terms of net addition. In the past, mobile phone is for voice communication or texting. But these days, the smartphone and tablet will be the center of mobile communication. And that's the paradigm shift, which is happening now, and that's why we have been working on promotion of smartphone and tablet. Now in the October-December period, the smartphones sold at electronics retail stores are tallied. And according to the survey, as you can see here, the number of smartphone we sold are far bigger than NTT and au. The combined total of NTT and au's smartphone sales is smaller than what we've sold in the past three months. Now, iPhone in centering on smartphone. And when it comes to iPhone 4S, sales that is when KDDI joined us to sell iPhone, and when that happened, we felt challenged because maybe nearly 1 million customers will switch to KDDI in favor of network reliability. So, we run promotion campaign to retain customers. Now, it turned out that the number of customers put out was around 50,000, only 50,000 for the three months period ended December. Only 50,000 customers put out. So our promotion campaign or measures to retain customers did work actually; worked far better than we expected. On top of that, we garnered highest customer satisfaction from iPhone users. According to the customer satisfaction survey of au iPhone users and SoftBank iPhone user, our SoftBank iPhone garnered higher level of customer satisfaction in terms of speed and other functionalities. Consumer survey revealed that fact. So that's why we didn't see a massive put out . When it comes to net addition for the past three months, actually our net addition was 1.5 times as much as au and our net addition was more than DOCOMO's net addition. Now, of course, to retain customers, we spent expenses, which is about \\xc2\\xa530 billion. We run a lot of campaign, promotion campaign, and we provided incentive to sales agent. And as a result, the number of upgrade was the biggest in the history of our iPhone sales in the three months period. So, upgrade expenses was \\xc2\\xa530 billion, which had negative impact on our income, but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so in other words, without the promotion campaign or retention campaign, operating income was \\xc2\\xa530 billion better. But we didn't care about one short-term profit. \\xc2\\xa530 billion expense now is important for us for the future income. And in the next two years those customers will bring in income and during the two-year period, the 900 megahertz may be granted. So, we could provide better connectivity, which will lead to a better customer satisfaction and a better churn rate and, then in turn then, we could enjoy the better customer base. So, that's why we decided to spend \\xc2\\xa530 billion in return for future income. And in spite the \\xc2\\xa530 billion expense, we achieved the record high operating income. Now, when it comes to total number of handsets sold, which is the total of new and upgrade customers, for the first time we surpassed KDDI. We sold more handsets to customers than KDDI did. To expand customer bases, we launched various types of handsets or terminals to expand our customer base. Now WILLCOM, which is under our group, although that company is not consolidated in our accounting, I'd like to talk about WILLCOM. Now, before WILLCOM came under our group, the WILLCOM was losing sales every year. WILLCOM had seen the loss of customers every year, and that's why the company went bankrupt, but SoftBank saved them. Right after WILLCOM joined the SoftBank Group, the company started to record positive growth of net addition. For the first time in six years, the WILLCOM recorded more than 500,000 net additions, and this graph shows the cumulative subscribers, and this is about PHS. PHS, with PHS and with the WILLCOM network and with damaged reputation, still the WILLCOM achieved the V-shaped recovery in terms of subscriber number and WILLCOM started to sell SoftBank terminals as well. So, in the third quarter the WILLCOM's cumulative subscriber is getting close to the WILLCOM's peak number of subscribers in the past. Also, the WILLCOM has been recording operating profit constantly. They are not booking losses. They are steadily generating operating income, steadily and then they are achieving V-shaped recovery in terms of subscriber's numbers. So, the combined number of subscribers of SoftBank and WILLCOM is 32.15 million. So, SoftBank Group's subscriber hit 30 million mark already. When SoftBank acquired Vodafone K.K, the subscriber was only 50 million. But since then, the number of cumulative subscribers doubled, and we are determined to expand customer base continuously. Now second strategy is to enhance network. We have built the structure to generate sustained operating income, and we are confident about that. So, that's why we'd like to be aggressive about network enhancement, so that we can further enhance customer satisfaction and expand customer base. So, we'd like to take the offensive in terms of network enhancement. Now, the customer satisfaction on network is defined by two factors, one is connectivity and the other is speed. Having those two factors, we can garner customer satisfaction in terms of network. So, first important factor is connectivity. The SoftBank network is not reliable. That's the most common complaint. And I know that, that was not good, and I was deeply mortified because customers are not satisfied about that. But to improve the connectivity, we doubled the number of base stations in the past year. And amongst all the mobile operators in the world, I believe, it is the massive expansion of the number of the base stations. So, from the 80,000 to 180,000, so it's 2.3 times in one year. It's easy to say, but it's really difficult to execute. And I believe that the way our network teams and the technology team has been putting all efforts into this achievement, and I'm very proud of them, and that they had a great job. So they had a great focus on this. And we've been not having a platinum band, but still we have to provide the coverage to the customers. So, that is why that we have no choice, but to increase the number of base stations. So, that's why that we had focus to expand the number of base stations. And clearly, speaking, we have exceeded the number of base stations of DOCOMO or KDDI. But still, because we're missing platinum band, but I don't want to use that as an excuse, but with this increase or enhancement of the number of base stations that we try to come to the equivalent number of the competitors. Connectivity ratio, when it comes to the numbers, you may go data wise that is increasing even without the platinum band, and thanks to our efforts. We had actually made our experimental research by making a call of about 50,000 to each operator and find out and calculate the connectivity ratio. And as a result, the DOCOMO was resulted in 98.9%, au was 98.8%, and we were 98.2%. So, we are in the 98% level, and then we caught up with the competitors. And to the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some few times before that we are still behind, compared to the competitors, and because without the platinum band, but we were able to get caught up with these competitors because we had no choice to increase the number of base stations, and I believe this result is now showing in the mid-numbers. In addition to that, we had Femtocell Installation Service. So, these femtocells or the home repeaters are not included in the number of base stations that I mentioned earlier in the slide. So, these are the outside of those numbers. But we have increased the number of those femtocells and the repeaters aggressively. And it was only introducing a partial area, but starting from January 2012, that we have executed nationwide. And moreover, we've been hearing that the DOCOMO and au having a very much difficult position in the network; especially DOCOMO is experiencing the tremendous increase in smartphone traffic. They've been struggling with the network trouble. And I believe we, Softbank, have sold the most numbers of the smartphones and the smartpads, and that's why that we had to offload those data traffic coming from these smartphone, smartpad. And that is why that we have increased dramatically in terms of number of Wi-Fi spots. DOCOMO officially made a comment few years ago that they don't need a Wi-Fi spot at all, but I believe that now they have only 7,700 Wi-Fi spots, au is 60,000. These are the publicly announced data. And we are now more than 200,000 Wi-Fi spots, especially those crowded area of Shinjuku-Higashiguchi, Ikebukuro, Ginza. So, those areas where that we cannot increase the number of base stations anymore are the kind of target that we've been increasing Wi-Fi spots, so that not only increasing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 improving this connectivity speed, but also we can offload those traffic coming from the customers. So, there was the connectivity factor. And when it comes to speed factor, we have announced the SoftBank 4G, the SoftBank 4G service. We are expecting to launch in the end of this month, which is a service of ultra-Wi-Fi 4G. So, downlink maximum 76 Mbps. Often they ask that the DOCOMO is very focused on LTE, but SoftBank may be behind the schedules of LTE; that question comes often. When it comes to SoftBank 4G strategy, this is substantially LTE; in the world, it is completely compatible with TD-LTE, so-called in the world. So, that is LTE. And the DOCOMO's LTE is FDD-LTE and ours is TD-LTE. The basic concept of LTE is the same between FDD-LTE and TD-LTE. So, I believe, the important thing is the result came out as a speed. And DOCOMO is 37.5 Mbps and the KDDI Group with WiMAX is 40 Mbps and us going to provides 76 Mbps. So, it's about twice as much of the competitor's speed that we are going to provide. And this is going to be available as a commercial service from the end of this month. So what is important, I believe, is the effective speed to the customers, and also, the actual coverage area. So, we didn't announce in advance regarding the new service like LTE, but actually, once we announced, we are executing the service and providing a service to the customers right after. So, that is kind of our style that we've been providing. So, we will start with this twice as much as speed, compared to the competitors. And also when it comes to the coverage, we are going to exceed the coverage area of DOCOMO for the LTE. And that is our target. So, for the next-generation communication network, we are going to be the number one in the industry. So with that in our management style, for the problem \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our operating income, in terms of operating income that we are exceeding KDDI's, and also, in terms of operating income that we would like to largely increase, compared to the DOCOMO one. And I believe that we are quite ready for that. So, that is why that we are going to have aggressive plans on the CapEx. And basically, that is the reason why that we have announced to spend CapEx of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in two years of 2011 and 2012. And when it comes to 900 megahertz, which is the platinum band, and SoftBank is the only one missing of this platinum band. And whenever I make a comment about the platinum band, some people say and criticize that that is not a good excuse to say that it's not the coverage. Well, whatever it is, but I will say this is the fact that we don't have this platinum band, compared to those two competitors, and not having this platinum band, I believe, is the huge disadvantage in terms of the coverage. So, most of the case that we've been having a bad reputation about the coverage, however, with this platinum band of 900 megahertz, it will be able to completely swept away this reputation, and we will be able to achieve the good coverage once we have about equal footing of this platinum band. And schedules of the MIC February is the month that they are going to announce the allocation of the license. And now that four companies are filing the application, DOCOMO, KDDI, us and EMOBILE. DOCOMO and KDDI already have their own platinum bands, so they have better environments to be able to reach to the customers. And they've been enjoying this platinum band for several years. And the only one operator, which is us, not having this platinum band, should be allocated with this band. And I'm quite confident and believe that can be used as a lifeline whenever we have any event or the disaster. And I believe this is very much necessary that looking back to last year's big disaster of the earthquake, if even one more of customers be able to have a connection to the mobile network, then that they may be able to have a better communication and I very much regret about the situations back then. So having this solid infrastructure is very much our responsibility, and that is why that I have a huge hope that the we will be able to allocated with this spectrum. And so that we will spend \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level of the CapEx in two years, so that we will be able to have safe and comfortable network to the customers. In summary, enhancement of the customer base and enhancement of network, with those two factors, we would like to achieve \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of operating income in the fiscal year 2016. So, we have set a target and setting the timeline for this target. So, what is the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level of the company? So, I'd like to summarize those. As mentioned earlier, DOCOMO in past five to six years, they've been experiencing about a flat operating income and now about \\xc2\\xa5844 billion in full year last year and this year again. I haven't shared that that they have been increasing to large, so that that they are about the same. And KDDI, also, in the past five to six years, they're not showing any of the tremendous increase, and we have passed their operating income. So if you extend this line towards 2016, that you'll be able to see next year that we're targeting \\xc2\\xa5700 billion of the operating income, and that is our target. And that will be leading us to the path of achieving the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level. So, in the worldwide, there are several companies with \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income and there are only 42 companies in the worldwide, so only 42 companies are achieving the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in operating income. In Japan, only NTT is recording this \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income. NTT of the holding company, I mean. So, under the consolidated basis, the holding company of NTT is the only one company of Japan that recorded \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income. In the past, there are only two Japanese companies who have exceeded \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income. One is NTT and the other is Toyota when they're having a peak. So, only those two were the companies, which recorded \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which has experience of recording \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in operating income. Now, Toyota is experiencing the operating income below \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, but they do have an experience of achieving it. And I mentioned that only 42 companies in the world, and the most of the companies in these 42 are related to the resource or the petroleum. And the automobiles, it's not many. And those top brands, top 10 brands in the world, so these are the top 10 brands in the world of which companies exceeding \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income are five companies only. We plotted those world top 10 brands in terms of operating income and market cap. And SoftBank is also plotted here and the world top 10 brands are along the approximated curve. Now SoftBank operating income will be hitting \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, but its market cap is far smaller than those top 10 brand company. Of top 10 brand company, the Coca-Cola had been number one for the past 10 years. Now, I am a person that who pursues the target until I achieve it. So, now I like to be comparable to Coca-Cola, which has been number one for the past 10 years. Now, Coca Cola's net sales is \\xc2\\xa52.73 trillion, but SoftBank's net sales of fiscal 2010 is \\xc2\\xa53 trillion. So, SoftBank is bigger in terms of net sales. Coca-Cola has a global operation, but SoftBank has operation only in Japan. Now, how about EBITDA? Actually, SoftBank's EBITDA is far bigger than Coca-Cola, EBITDA growth is far bigger than Coca-Cola's. When it comes to operating income, we're nearly the same as Coca-cola last year. So, it's just a matter of time to surpass Coca-Cola, which is the world's top brand. We could surpass \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are aiming to surpass the Coca Cola in all KPI, but our market cap is far smaller than Coca Cola. Why? Maybe investors are turning blind eyes to SoftBank, maybe. But I believe that investors will realize the real value of SoftBank, not immediately, but eventually they will recognize our value because we are bigger than Coco-Cola in terms of many KPIs, but our name recognition is not so high. And just a couple of years ago, we were at the top list of companies that were likely to go bankrupt, but we had change that situation. Now how about SoftBank's valuation? So, let's hear the voice of market. Well, I did a quick math. Our market cap, as of yesterday, is \\xc2\\xa52.4 trillion. And SoftBank has assets, which is not counted in our sales, which is the shares of Internet companies or stakes in the Internet companies, which is about \\xc2\\xa51 trillion worth. So, SoftBank's market cap is \\xc2\\xa52.4 trillion. But we have stakes, which values about \\xc2\\xa51.6 trillion. So, if we exclude that from our market cap, for most of our EBITDA is about \\xc2\\xa50.8 trillion. So, take \\xc2\\xa52.4 trillion market cap, less \\xc2\\xa51.6 trillion of the values of our stakes, the result is \\xc2\\xa50.8 trillion. So, our telecom business is valuated as just \\xc2\\xa50.8 trillion. Now let's compare this with other telecom operators. This slide shows market cap and EBITDA multiple. Usually, the major telecom operator's EBITDA multiple is about four times to five times. In [indiscernible] (50:38), the EBITDA is the most important measurement and ours is just one-time, which is unusually low, too low. So, I believe that investors will recognize eventually about our value. Maybe some people get upset by saying that I am fooling the investors, but I'd like to mention about undervalued SoftBank shares. But anyway here I declare that our company will aim to achieve \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income in 2016. And to achieve that, we will make all our efforts. Maybe we will achieve the target in fiscal 2017, just one year difference, it could happen. But anyway, we'd like to declare that we will walk toward this target. And I hope you will accept my big mouth. Thank you for your attention. Now, we'd like to open the floor for questions\",\n",
       " '2011 Q4': 'I am Son of SoftBank. Thank you very much for today. And we just have closed the fiscal 2011, and I would like to announce the results. And looking back at the past one year, we had bigger stakes and had lot of confusions in the country. For the SoftBank, at the end of last year, we have seen the selling from KDDI on iPhone. So, since the launch of Mobile business, that was the kind of a biggest milestone that we have faced. And how that turned out; that could impact to our business quite largely. Number of users in SoftBank Mobile, we have about 30 million, and 10%, quite large amount of customers are the user of iPhone now, and that could be 7 million customers that could go to KDDI for their iPhone, then that was a scenario that we\\'ve been assuming. And how are we going to protect those customer? That was the very big challenge for us especially where we\\'ve been claimed by customers about the weak coverage in some places. So, management of ours been discussing to avoid such situation where that the people really have to lose the customers. And at the same time, we\\'ve been working hard to improve the coverage with the base stations, sales and marketing and also explanation to customers at the shops. So, there are so many efforts that we\\'ve been looking to, so somehow those iPhone users with our network that we had to protect those customers, and that was the most important and most prioritized challenge that we\\'ve been facing. So that we put several initiatives, also had several promotions. And actually in the third quarter, we spent about \\xc2\\xa530 billion and \\xc2\\xa510 billion in fourth quarter for such promotion events, promotion cost to protect those customers. As a result, we found out there were only some thousand customers where we were expecting like 1 million or so. That was a kind of the situation, but actually much less than those customers who have left SoftBank and went to KDDI through MNP, mobile number probability. So, as a result that I could say that was the best situation, best result. Of course, it came along with the additional cost, additional spending, including those promotions and initiatives, which was \\xc2\\xa530 billion in third quarter and \\xc2\\xa510 billion in fourth quarter. So, that was a special cost that we had to spend. However, we were able to protect those customers. And that situation has been coming down. And we\\'ve been reducing and almost none for the additional promotion. So, that was the one-time peak of the special spending. But still, that some tens of thousands of customers just left SoftBank to move on to KDDI. So, 90-some percent of the customer we were able to protect. And for the new acquisitions, we were able to see the good numbers of customers who came to SoftBank network. So, net addition-wise, that there was also good result, so that in total, there were lots of challenges. But we were able to overcome those, and also were able to make increase in profit and revenue without any excuses. So, in the new fiscal year, fiscal year 2012, we\\'ll be able to expect the stable increase in revenue and profit from those customers that we newly added in fiscal 2011. And I would like to go into details about those in results. Here shows the highlights. Domestic number three in operating income for three consecutive years, achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion EBITDA for the first time and ranked within domestic net income, top 10. Consolidated earnings results, as you see, net sales since the launch of Mobile business, we\\'ve been making a steady increase. EBITDA actually made a even better increase and achieved the first time \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. As for EBITDA, again, the first time that we have surpassed KDDI. Doesn\\'t necessarily mean that those two competitors making a good increase, but we\\'ve been making a steady increase in EBITDA. In the domestic EBITDA ranking, we are number four in Japan and, again, making a steady improvement here. In Japan, not many cases that they\\'re talking about EBITDA, but when you go to Europe or U.S. that EBITDA is the main index to discuss the business situation. So, that\\'s because the depreciation, goodwill amortizations, how you see those elements are different from each country\\'s, each market\\'s accounting rules. But, internationally, that EBITDA is a kind of a main index to talk about. And now that we\\'ve been achieving \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in EBITDA; operating income, we had record high for seven consecutive years, with 7% increase. And in the third quarter, \\xc2\\xa530 billion and \\xc2\\xa510 billion in fourth quarter, so those are used for the promotion cost for the protection of iPhone users. So, with those, but still we were able to hit the increase in operating income. And operating income \\xc2\\xa5675.2 billion compared to those two competitors trend, really making a quite steady improvement here. Again, the domestic operating income ranking, we\\'ve been in number three for three consecutive years. At the time we ranked number three in three years before, it was like a very good luck of SoftBank that we are lucky to be in number three amongst the all industry, but we were able to consecutively stay in this position for second and third year, so that this is not a one-time luck of SoftBank. But I am proud to say that this is a sustainable revenue model, has been established in SoftBank, making a steady increase in customer base and also having improved and enhanced revenue structure. And when it comes to operating margin, we were surpassing DOCOMO for two consecutive years. When it comes to the infrastructure business, size is always important and they are the one that having twice as much of the customer base, which means that they should be recording the better operating margin. KDDI 13.4%. Us, we\\'re hitting 21%. So, over 20% for three consecutive years. So, making a steady increase in operating margin even though that we have less customer base, but making better operating margin is because we have a strong business operations going forward. This is the domestic operating margin ranking amongst the companies with operating income exceeding \\xc2\\xa5200 billion and we are in number four in Japan. Ordinary income 10% increase in our absolute figure and also recording high for three consecutive years. Net income, record high for three consecutive years, 65% increase. Net income absolute figure wise, again, surpassing KDDI and that you can see the trend of SoftBank. In some years, we will be catching up and even surpassing DOCOMO. That\\'s how I see the situation. And domestic net income ranking, again, the first time within the top 10 amongst the old industries in Japan. That means, we have Yahoo Japan and those companies which is not how they present consolidated and not making a good net income. So, sometimes, that they\\'re hitting a better operating income, but it doesn\\'t make a good net income. However, again, this time, that we are making a steady increase and improvement in net income. And here the summary of consolidated earnings results and in all aspects, we\\'ve been making improvement. Cash flow, as you can see on this slide. Operating cash flow and free cash flow are also making steady improvement. Here, want you to look back. About three years ago, just about three years ago, there was the Lehman shock. As you see, operating income of SoftBank has been recording a record-high for seven consecutive years. So, it\\'s making a steady revenue and profit. However, just three years ago when there was the Lehman shock, share price of SoftBank plunged. And at the same time, the CDS spread went up 2,266 base point. So, as a listed company, this is unbelievable CDS points and almost covered by media that these are the most possible companies with bankruptcy. So, at that time [indiscernible] (14:16) in SoftBank was most likely to be bankrupt. Unfortunately, that the [indiscernible] (14:21) was bankrupt, but we were able to record high figures in operating income for three consecutive years and also domestic number three in operating income, so steadily making a good profit. But three years ago, we were a bit almost close to bankrupt. There was media writing the articles about. But looking back \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but then that was a very weird situation. At that time, right after the acquisition of business, we had quite a large number of net interest-bearing debt. So, looking at the absolute figures of debt, there were some rumors about the bankruptcy. So, at that time, we announced two commitments; one, to generate \\xc2\\xa51 trillion free cash flow in three years; and second, to reduce the net interest-bearing debt by half. And the first commitment or target we announced, which was to generate free cash flow of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in three years, but actually aggregated free cash flow for the past three years is \\xc2\\xa51.3 trillion. When we talked about \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, many people said that SoftBank\\'s plan is like a fraud or just \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only a bluff, or some people said that SoftBank said so because they want to shore up their share price. But actually, we already generated \\xc2\\xa51.3 trillion of free cash flow. Also, for the past three years, we renewed the operating income target every year. Another target having the net interest-bearing debt, that was reduced more than half, \\xc2\\xa50.5 trillion. Lease obligation is also \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if we include lease obligations for the total debt, the net interest and debt cost, lease obligation was more than \\xe2\\x82\\xac2 trillion, but right now it\\'s less than \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right now it\\'s about \\xc2\\xa51.1 trillion. So, we fulfilled our commitment. And, as a result, interest expense was nearly half of what was three years ago because our net interest debt was halved. Now, net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA multiple is also reduced more than half. So, the debt reduced significantly, but EBIT increased sharply, so the multiple was down from 2.9 times to 0.5 times. Even if you the include lease obligations, the multiple is down from 3.5 times to 1.1 times. So, judging from all these measurements or readings, our financial data, which include \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually you cannot find any other Japanese company, which reduced net interest-bearing debt that much in such a short time. Another result, SoftBank\\'s credit rating improved significantly and right now, we have the best rating ever since the founding of the company. So, our announced target, strengthening financial status, was achieved. So, like as of today, few people talk about the possibility of SoftBank\\'s bankruptcy. Now, I\\'d like to announce our new financial strategy. So far, right after the credit crisis triggered by the Lehman Brothers collapse, we announced that we should reduce our net interest-bearing debt by half and eventually to zero. That was the most important management focus in terms of financial strategy. But so far, we have reduced the net interest-bearing debt more than by half. And recently, the shareholders are telling us about our strategy which is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually, some people said, some shareholders said that just keep working to reduce the net debt to zero is not really like what SoftBank\\'s style. So, that\\'s why I\\'d like to announce the revised strategy, which is addition of shareholder return. So far, at Annual Shareholders\\' Meeting, a lot of shareholders voiced some concern about the shareholders\\' return and investors also pointed out that it might be the right time for SoftBank to take the issue of shareholders\\' return. Now, so far, we worked hard to reduce the net interest-bearing debt to zero. Even so we have to compromise with the strategic growth for our shareholders\\' return, but we would not pass \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we will not comprise with the growth opportunity. And, at the same time, we will focus on shareholders\\' return. So, we are going to strike the right balance of those three things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 strategic growth shareholders\\' return and net interest-bearing debt reduction. Now, first of all, the dividend per share after fiscal year 2008, we doubled the dividend from \\xc2\\xa52.5 to \\xc2\\xa55. And at that time, we said that once we fulfill the free cash flow commitments, and the net debt halving target, we would further increase the dividends in fiscal 2011 and then again increase the dividends in fiscal 2014, but decided to accelerate the dividend increase done. So, in fiscal 2011, we will increase the dividend to \\xc2\\xa540 from \\xc2\\xa55, which is the eight times increase and the total amount of dividends will be \\xc2\\xa543.9 billion. And here is dividend yield. So far, our dividend yield was too low, many people complained. But we will increase it by 11 times to 1.63% from 0.15%. So, we are going to enhance shareholder return as summarized on this page. So, our former policy on net-interest-bearing debt was to reduce to zero, but our new policy is to keep the net-interest-bearing-debt level at appropriate level. At the same time, we will strike a good balance with shareholders\\' return and growth strategy with debt reduction. But this announcement would invite another question which is, \"Are we going to invest more on renewable energy business now that we changed the policy?\" Actually, our investment on the renewable energy business will have only minor impact on our consolidated earnings. Our renewable energy business should be the catalyst of deployment of renewable energy in Japan. So far, Japan\\'s energy policy has been reliant on nuclear power, but we\\'d like to take a risk and become a catalyst of shifting to the renewable energy forecast, but our investment on renewable energy business is less than 1% of total asset. So, in the fiscal 2012, we are aiming to beat consolidated operating income target of \\xc2\\xa5700 billion. But we are refraining from announcing the earnings forecast for the full year, but we are aiming to beat operating income target of \\xc2\\xa5700 billion so that we will continue to increase our profits and revenue in 2012. On top of that, we have mid-term goal or target, which is achieving \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of consolidated operating income in the fiscal 2016, which exceeds the NTT DOCOMO\\'s current level of operating income. Of course, we have smaller customer base than DOCOMO and our connectivity is not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 may not be so strong, but still, we will work to achieve the target of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of consolidated operating income in 2016. So far, whenever we announced the mid-term goal, we always delivered the results. We always fulfilled the goal. So, we are determined to achieve this target. And Mobile Communications business will be the driving force of operating income growth. And so far, in terms of subscriber net addition, it was number one. And actually, it\\'s been number one for the past five years. Not only the SoftBank Mobile, but also WILLCOM is performing well. The WILLCOM was under court-protected bankruptcy procedures and we decided to make the company under our umbrella. And the company was losing the subscribers before joining SoftBank Group, but on the second month, and under the SoftBank Group, they started increasing the number of subscribers. And, since then, it\\'s been generating income. It swung into the black. So, it\\'s been changing or improving the management structure and business structure like in the case of the Mobile business under the umbrella of Vodafone, it\\'s been reviving and turning around. So, so far we have cumulative subscribers more than \\xc2\\xa533 million. And on this graph, the left portion is under the Vodafone K.K. Back then, the number of subscribers leveled off and ARPU were decreasing every month. And the number of users stayed flat. But once the Mobile business joined SoftBank Group it started to increase the net addition. Actually, it has been number one in terms of net addition for five years. Telecom service revenue of Mobile Communications business has been increasing every year. It\\'s not just one-time increase from the handset sales, but this is about the telecom service revenue, which is the most important performance measurement. And telecom service revenue growth of SoftBank is number one even compared with major players in the world, China Mobile with a handset penetration that is lower than in Japan. But even compared with such a company, our growth rate is higher because of the increase of data income. Our voice-related revenue has been flat, but that was made up for by the increase of customers. So, that\\'s why our voice revenue has been flat, and all the incremental revenue was from data revenue. So, that\\'s why the SoftBank is the provider of data service. And in terms of data ARPU ratio, SoftBank is number one even in the world. Since acquisition of Vodafone K.K., I never even think about running a company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a mobile telephone company. I didn\\'t intend to acquire the phone company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mobile phone company. But my goal is always to beat the mobile Internet so that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I actually changed the company from mobile phone company to mobile Internet company. So, that was the goal from the beginning and this became the reality. 65% is the world number one ratio in terms of data ARPU. And if you\\'re depending on the voice and SMS, I believe that the situation will be going worse. But our case, it\\'s already two-thirds of the revenue is coming from data. So, the business model itself has been changed to data oriented. As a result, customer numbers were flat and the ARPU was declining in the time of Vodafone. So, they were suffering from the declining of the operating income. So, if there is another year, if we wait, then they are almost coming close to zero in operating income. So, most of the people said that this acquisition was nonsense. However, it turned out that we were able to make five times of operating income \\xe2\\x80\\x93 operating income growth. Here again compared to the major players in the world that we are reporting number one. And those company like China Mobile, which is expanding their customer base, but we are making three times of their operating income growth compared to China Mobile. It doesn\\'t necessarily mean that because of the Japanese market, because if you see those two competitors in Japan, they were stating negative figures here, on the other hand that we\\'re making the best growth in the world. This is because it is SoftBank. So, under such circumstance, we had the last hurdle, which was the coverage. After the acquisition of Vodafone, there was some people pointed out that the coverage was worse. But that was because \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that was not really the reality. As a matter of fact, at the time of acquisition, the number of base station was only 20,000, after then that we have increased 10 times and we\\'ll be making every effort to improve the situation. Of course, in these base stations, that\\'s not in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the base stations that we do have some repeater or femtos. Well, I\\'m not priding because of the numbers of base stations, but what we are trying to achieve is to provide the better service even without the Platinum Band. So, I didn\\'t want to use the excuse of not having the Platinum Band, but we wanted to have a better service to the customers. So, that is why we\\'re putting every effort to increase the number of base stations. On top of that, we always suffer from the congestions because the traffic of the smartphone is increasing tremendously. Compared to the conventional handset, the traffic is like 10 times or 20 times per handset. So, when it comes to the metropolitan area, and to accommodate those traffic in those crowded area, we have to have a bypass solution using Wi-Fi spots. So, again, that we put every effort to increase the number of Wi-Fi spots. Competitors not depending on Wi-Fi, but they try to do with 3G, and that was the official comments. But, in the meantime, that we actually putting our efforts on increasing the number of Wi-Fi spots and now that we have overwhelming numbers of Wi-Fi spot compared to the competitors. Here shows the speed, and this is not measured in a Wi-Fi, but in 3G area. So, because we have better number of base stations, which means that we\\'d be able to have more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for less numbers of customers, we accommodate it in one base station. So, not having a Platinum Band that we have to increase the number of base stations, which means that we will be able to have smaller number of customers to accommodate in the base stations so that we\\'d be able to reduce the congestion. So, which means that the traffic speed per user becomes faster. So, that\\'s the kind of logic we\\'ve been working out in increasing the number of base stations, so that as a result, this is the third-party survey and the articles from Nikkei TRENDY in the speed survey of iPhone 4S at Shibuya, daytime. The same iPhone comparison, iPhone 4S to iPhone 4S, so, we were \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our iPhone 4S was showing 2.6 times faster. And again, in Shinjuku, nighttime, 3.4 times faster speed compared to the au\\'s iPhone. So, I believe that we had a smaller cells with more numbers of base stations led us to this situation. So, I\\'m not trying to say the number of base stations or that we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\'d like to appeal the number of base stations, but we are trying to provide better service and try to improve our coverage. And here, the launch of 900 megahertz service, which was long waited, well, so-called Platinum Band, like the competitors that we have been allocated with this Platinum Band now. So, 800 megahertz was held by DOCOMO and KDDI. So, we had a disadvantage in coverage. However, this time, without any excuse, with this allocation, we have license to provide the service with 900 megahertz so that we\\'d like to have aggressive network coverage with the spendings. And here, again, the external research company, about the intention to subscribe to SoftBank, after the allocations of the Platinum Band and knowing that the Platinum Band is allocated to SoftBank, we ask consumers, \"Do you have intention to subscribe to SoftBank?\" And we have a 30% increase of those who would \\xe2\\x80\\x93 wish to use or subscribe to SoftBank. And another question here was that those people who are leaving SoftBank network and for those leaving customers that we asked, after the allocation of the SoftBank and once those \\xe2\\x80\\x93 base station start launching, are you again going to leave the SoftBank network, but that has reduced from 47% to 20%. So, it was about halved, so that we\\'ll be able to reduce those reasons why that they are leaving SoftBank. So, from the management point of view, we will be able to reduce these reasons of leaving the network by spending CapEx. And that\\'s how we see the situation. So, 900 megahertz compatible devices is necessary to take an advantage of this 900 megahertz spectrum. So, including the chipset, filter, antenna, those needs to be ready to provide the service of 900 megahertz. But those iPhone, iPad, the international band equipped so that these will be available, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, those customers will be able to use with their existing handsets. We have 3 and the 3GS customers that we had a promotion to switch or upgrade. The promotion was implemented to iPhone 4S. And the reason that we have aggressive promotion is because that once the customers start using iPhone 4S then they\\'ll be able to take advantage 900 megahertz spectrum right away. So, that was one of the reason why that we encourage customer to switch from iPhone 3G or 3GS to iPhone 4S so that we\\'ll be able to provide a better coverage to those customers earlier as possible. And also, the PANTONE, one of the best-selling handsets, those are already equipped with 900-megahertz service. And from now and after, those new models will be equipped with 900 megahertz compatible. So, all models is expected to be ready. We are considering to make all models to be able to utilize 900 megahertz so that we\\'ll be able to improve the coverage and, at the same time, when it comes to speed, now that we\\'re seeing that worldwide it\\'s heading towards the mobile broadband, so, the mobile phone is not a voice machine anymore or voice tool anymore, but it\\'s becoming a tool to enjoy the Internet. And when it comes to the mobile Internet, speed is always the key. So, that I always recognize the importance of the speed. And now that I believe that we\\'re entering into the competitions about the LTE subscription and with TD-LTE, we are already providing the world\\'s fastest speed with maximum downlink of 110 mega bps. Here, our TD-LTE with SoftBank 4G compared with KDDI\\'s latest device, which is UQ WiMAX and also for DOCOMO\\'s LTE, when we compare the speed of those latest device, we have more than twice faster than those two. So, this is not just under the specification speed, but this is the effective speed, and already we are providing double the speed. In addition, after this fall, we are also expected to provide FDD-LTE and the flat rate plan for smartphones, \\xc2\\xa55,985 per month, which is equivalent to the price of DOCOMO\\'s. So, for those services, we need to have a CapEx. 2010, fiscal year 2010, with the 900 megahertz and the TD-LTE that we are expecting to have a peak of CapEx in 2012, and we would like to bring \\xe2\\x80\\x93 accelerate the CapEx, and then that we will peak out in fiscal 2013, and later that we\\'re expecting to coming down the level of CapEx. And for the further growth, here that I would like to have a big look back. On 20th centuries three sacred treasures was washing machine, refrigerator and monochrome TV, but when it comes to the new three sacred treasures, it should be smartphone, tablet and the cloud/SNS. So, that the smartphones era is becoming the full-pledged trend and which means I foresaw this situation much earlier than the others and shifted in full speed to the smartphone compared to those two competitors. So, for the mobile users, infrared or the e-wallet or TVs, those were the kind of the main key functions that were set by the competitor CEOs. And if those functions are not available in iPhone, then the iPhone will never be able to sell in Japanese market. Having said that, we didn\\'t agree with those CEOs and we shifted towards the smartphones and put our efforts in terms of resources and also monies. And, as a result, that we\\'ll be able to keep our net additions momentum and also increase our sales of smartphones. So, not only protecting those existing customers, but if the current DOCOMO user wished to start using iPhone, we asked those customers, DOCOMO users, \"Do you wish to change to SoftBank\\'s iPhone or use au\\'s iPhone?\" This is again the external research company\\'s survey. And one-fourth of them didn\\'t know, but other than them, more than half chose SoftBank\\'s iPhone. Even they didn\\'t know, but they\\'re looking at \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if they go proportionately divided between SoftBank and au, I believe that two-thirds of those customers or even more than two-thirds of the customers will be the SoftBank user. So, those are the customers who are switching from DOCOMO to SoftBank. So, even though that coverage is not yet equivalent levels against the coverage of the KDDI or DOCOMO, but still, that the DOCOMO users would chose SoftBank iPhone. And tablet, the bestselling tablet in the world is iPad and that is true in Japan as well. So, out of tablet, in the tablet market, iPads has number one share. And the new iPad, the latest model of iPad, it\\'s sold only by SoftBank in Japan. And it\\'s very important to acquire customer in the first couple of months of the launch of new product. And actually, we are the only seller of the iPad, new iPad. And we will continue to be the pioneer of iPads \\xe2\\x80\\x93 tablet market in Japan. And the new iPad was upgraded version of iPad 2 and actually I\\'m using new iPad, and it\\'s easy on my eye because of the high resolution and the faster processing speed makes the use of new iPad risk-free. And actually, Apple announced record high income the other day. Their income increased more than 90% because of the strong sales of iPhone and iPad. And new iPad is selling very well in Japan as well. Then cloud, the cloud market has been growing significantly. Out in the cloud world, the most important application is Google Apps, in my view. The Google Apps improve the business efficiency or operational efficiency. Actually, in SoftBank, all of the employees are using Google Apps. And since the implementation of Google Apps, the productivity has improved dramatically. And we are selling Google Apps to enterprise customers, and we are the number one partner of Google, because the number of acquired Google Apps for business ID right, we are number one. So, Google was impressed by SoftBank\\'s performance of selling Google Apps. Of course, KDDI and DOCOMO are not selling Google Apps to enterprise customer yet, but right now SoftBank is working to sell the Google Apps to enterprise customers. And this is one of the differentiator of our business than others. Of course, this is a clear application. And recently \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the recent example, Sompo Japan Insurance decided to use Google Apps with 30,000 IDs and same goes with Kokuyo, the office suppliers and Nikken Sekkei. And in SoftBank, not only the Google Apps, but also Facebook and Twitter and other SNS are being used by employees. We have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is the SoftBank\\'s corporate culture. We are not just a mobile phone company, but we are a mobile Internet company and that is our corporate culture, and that\\'s one of the differentiator of SoftBank\\'s business from all the others. We acquired the right of exclusive selling \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sales of certain products that\\'s the strategy or tactic thing, but the most important thing to be number one is to establish a corporate culture. And that corporate culture should reflect business domain that what one company pursue for medium and long term, so in that sense SoftBank is most advanced because we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our corporate culture is based on the mobile Internet and that results in our highest ARPU, data ARPU revenue in the world. So all these IT \\xe2\\x80\\x93 making the most of IT and broadband and SoftBank Telecom shows a good \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great example. After they start using the iPad and iPhone, the contracts per person they earned is increased by 1.8 times. Also, the SoftBank Telecom number of service line per employee increased by 2.2 times. So, the productivity per employee has improved significantly because our employees are using iPad, iPhone and other things. And as a result, our productivity is much, much better than that of DOCOMO and KDDI, in my view. Also, two weeks ago, I declared one ambitious goal, which is no use of paper for internal purpose, and any employee who would breach that would go out or could quit. Of course, it\\'s not possible to reduce the use of paper to zero, but we are going paperless. Of course, some supervisory agency won\\'t accept the document in other forms than paper, so we have to use paper. And also, from time to time, we need to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we do need to use paper, but with all those exceptions aside, we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most of the paper we are using are for internal purpose. So, we should reduce that to zero. We have 20,000 employees, but they all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 each one of them have iPhone and iPads and each one of them uses Google Apps, so there\\'s no point of using printout using paper. So, in the next earnings result announcement session, three months later, you will not see any paper material. So, unless you bring your laptop PC, or iPads, you will not get data or presentation material. Of course, we will distribute the paper-based material at the presentation session at the SEC . And, of course, there might be some exception, but I\\'d like to tell all of you in this room, analysts and journalists alike, three months later when you are joining our \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the earnings results announcement session, you will not see any paper material. In SoftBank, anyone who uses paper for internal purpose is [indiscernible] (54:36). But this currently results in the improved productivity and income and less overtime and speed-up all the processes and that will enhance the happiness of employees. So, why not we should go in paperless. So, we believe that it\\'s possible to achieve our target of going paperless. Now, the Japanese market, especially the mobile communication market is saturated so some people start saying that SoftBank growth is not expected in the future, but actually that is not totally true because we expect that M2M market will increase by 10 times in 10 years. Honda Motors are using \\xe2\\x80\\x93 producing car navigation, and their car navigation system uses SoftBank\\'s M2M module chip. So far, 160,000 lines worth of module were shipped already, and we are going to increase that. As a matter of fact, we\\'re receiving inquiries from other automakers, automobile makers. All our expertise and know-how we have built up will be made most of in M2M world. I cannot tell all the examples about M2M sales, but we expect M2M market will grow by 10 times in 10 years. Another important revenue source is SoftBank Selection business. None of the mobile carrier in the world is working on this type of business. None of the mobile carrier in the world is launching the PhotoVision like desktop photo frame or Mimamori. We are the pioneer of developing new type of products. And also, we are selling accessories as well and that\\'s the first model \\xe2\\x80\\x93 business model of mobile communication carrier in the world. And SoftBank Selection accessory business is growing sales. The sales double every year and the margin is great as well. And we want to grow this business further. Now, one of the growth company, Yahoo!, which has freshened up its management, installing young executives, actually, the average age of executive members is nine years younger than before. And the new policy was announced, which is \\'Smartphone First.\\' So far, the PC was the main \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the core area of business, but they are going to shift it to smartphone. And the page views for smartphone increased 160 times in the past few years and commerce transaction via smartphones increased 14 times. And the number of applications available in smartphone will increase as well. So, Yahoo! is our strategic subsidiary, is focusing on smartphone. And SoftBank is also focusing on smartphone. So, we have our management policy converged. So, that\\'s why we can generate a synergy through this vertical integration model. None other competitors are doing this, also \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so we will explore further synergies, so that Yahoo!\\'s operating income will increase further. And accordingly, the SoftBank\\'s data ARPU will increase further. In that way we\\'ll be number one, overwhelming number one in the smartphone market. And that way, we will likely be achieving the target of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income in 2016. Actually, our operating income is about 1.5 times of that of KDDI today. Now, I\\'d like to talk about the global game change. Let\\'s look at the household spending and the portion of the household spending on car is decreasing, while the spending on information communication is increasing. Now, market capitalization-wise, information communication industry generated six times more value while all the other industries, including auto industries and electronic appliance industries, their market capitalization have been leveling off. Just a decade ago, the information communication industry\\'s market capitalization was less than half of other industries. So, the leading role has changed. But then it was a product and mainly, that you have said the old management is saying that we were originally from the product, or the manufacturers business, but they still keep going on, and that I believe that there will mislead the management sales because the big trend has already been changed. But if you stick to those product industry, manufacturing industry and if you go always that then, that Japanese company only becomes a part company. Only the part of the liquid LCD or the screws or those. So that it\\'s like subcontractors. So, you are just delivering the parts with chips in the specific. That kind of era has already been finished. Not the parts or the products, but not only the products, but also needs to include the cloud and needs to see the total picture of the business model. Otherwise, that you mislead them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the company. So, we always need to see the total system including the information system as a core business. Otherwise, you\\'ll never be able to lead the company to the next generation. Car navigation system is already equipped with communication and the TV also having communications. Not the stereo TV, but TV with Internet. Otherwise, \\xc2\\xa540,000 with 40-inches, that kind of price is now happening. So, that\\'s why that I believe switching of the leading role is now about to finish. And we\\'re actually in the era of information. So, scale of Internet economy, now that \\xc2\\xa5270 trillion, but in few years, I believe, that\\'ll be hitting \\xc2\\xa5350 trillion. And this is fourth out of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 compared to the other global GDP countries. In such a situation, SoftBank having the 900 Internet companies is within the Group. And most of the 900 companies, we are the majority of the shareholder. So, Internet services, SoftBank, most of the operating income or most of the EBITDA is coming from telecommunication or communication business, so that SoftBank is recognized as a communications company and not really recognized as a Internet company. And I feel that many people seeing us as a communication company, but I would like to take this opportunity, once again, to revise your view. We are the Internet company, with 900 Internet companies inside of our Group. So, we are the one that\\'s pursuing the mobile Internet. That\\'s why that we acquired a mobile phone company, but what where we\\'re always heading towards is in Internet. So, our core business is Internet and the reason as to having a mobile phone company is because to pursue the mobile Internet. And here\\'s the number of users of SoftBank Group and now that hitting \\xc2\\xa51.4 billion, and of which \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whenever that I show this graph, then \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or the Alipay users were included. But Alipay users are almost redundant with the Alibaba. So, that\\'s going to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\'s the double count. So, this time, intentionally, we exclude the number of users of Alipay. So, excluding the Alipay users numbers and other than that, we accumulate the number of the Internet users. That would be the 1.4 billion. So, as an Internet company, we\\'re having a reach towards \\xc2\\xa51.4 billion from the SoftBank. So, compared to the world\\'s population, now we\\'re hitting number one in the world. You can laugh at that, but this is the fact. Maybe you cannot take it too serious about this but maybe you can relax and hear this fact. But here, the compare \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it shouldn\\'t be apple-to-apple comparison. But this is one of the major. You can see this is a kind of numbers that you\\'re looking at. Actually, that we are number one population in the world and actually is making the double the count in every-year basis. So, redundancy that could be about 20% customer base-wise. So, about 20% is overlapping amongst the 1.4 billion. But other than that, they are not the redundant numbers. And also once again that it\\'s increasing two times in every year and not the number three companies, mobile companies in Japan. But it\\'s the company with the biggest populations reach in the Internet world. So, that the market cap of SoftBank currently is \\xc2\\xa52.5 trillion, of which those listed companies in the SoftBank Group, I mentioned that 900 group companies are there in the Internet. But out of which, ten some companies are listed, and Alibaba not listed yet, but already evaluated by the third party at about six months ago was about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 made \\xc2\\xa5100 billion level of the increase in revenue. So, we\\'ve used that numbers as a reference here, then sometime soon if it goes to public, then that could be even more. But, currently, the current value we\\'re expecting around \\xc2\\xa51.7 trillion. Other than that, about 890 out of 900 is counted at zero. We\\'re spending the investment there, and some of them are already making revenue, but still recognizing as zero. So, even as we discount as a percent, but still, our value is \\xc2\\xa51.7 trillion coming from Internet companies of SoftBank. And taking that out, then the \\xc2\\xa50.8 trillion is the value of telecommunications business. So, EBITDA, operating income \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most of the part is coming from the three telecommunications company or the SoftBank Mobile, so that sometimes the Internet analyst is forgetting about SoftBank because it seems like a mobile company. However, that is why that I try to remind you once again that we are the Internet company. And here, the market cap comparison. KDDI is \\xc2\\xa52.3 trillion, which is a competitor above us. And we are recording \\xc2\\xa52.5 trillion. And breakdown, they have J:COM and other some shares, other. We, again, have Yahoo! Japan and others. So, we both have our listed companies or some companies close to listed company taking that out and see the value of the telecommunications business, then the \\xc2\\xa5 2.1 trillion versus \\xc2\\xa50.8 trillion. So taking those elements, other than telecommunications business out from the market cap then that is \\xc2\\xa52.1 trillion versus \\xc2\\xa50.8 trillion. But as I mentioned earlier, when it comes to SoftBank and KDDI, we have much better operating income compared to KDDI and the average growth we are showing 49% and KDDI\\'s 8% in CAGR. So, the absolute figures, growth ratio, we completely surpassed KDDI and consolidated base as well. So, under such circumstance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1.6 times operating income and compared to the other Internet companies in the world in the past six months that we are showing 49%, Google was 33%. We are not beating up all, but compared to the other Internet companies such as Amazon, eBay and other companies in these past five to six years, we are beating those others, so when compared to those famous names of Internet companies that we are making great result in terms of growth. And most of the part out of our overall value of the company is coming from Internet-related. So, having 900 Internet companies and also having enough and the rich free cash flow. So, in a simple term, we are the Warren Buffet of Internet or the Berkshire Hathaway of Internet. So, having a cash flow \\xe2\\x80\\x93 rich cash flow on my left-hand side and also having a good portfolio on our right-hand side, so that those portfolio we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 having a better growing ratio of companies compared to Coca-Cola or McDonald\\'s and also the free cash flow instead of insurance business, we have a communication business, comparing with the Berkshire Hathaway so that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and at the same time, we\\'re making record high operating income and revenue. So, that\\'s why that I again \\xe2\\x80\\x93 once again, that I would like to remind you is it really true that the one times of EBITDA is the right valuations for SoftBank. Comparison with right after the listed in past 10 years or so, it was \\xc2\\xa50.2 trillion market cap and now becomes \\xc2\\xa52.5 trillion and also \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of operating income is recorded steadily basis. And that combining from the value of investment and value of business. And we would like to seek for the further growth. So, as mentioned earlier, so far, we have suffered from Lehman shock so that we\\'ve been mentioning that to bring the net-interest-bearing debt down to zero. That was the most important challenge, but in past three years, we have already reduced more than half, so that we are going to revise this plan. But that is because we have enough data to make a good return to shareholder, having a good income and also making a good return to investment. Also, from now on that we would like to consider a steady return to shareholders and having an eight times of the dividend this time, but doesn\\'t necessarily mean that we are giving up the growth or we are stopping our growth, but we would like to keep going on with the growth. So we\\'ve been making a growth, but as an Internet company, we would like to keep this momentum and keep growing. So, those three should be balanced together so that we\\'ll be able to maximize the shareholders\\' value. Thank you very much for your attention. That is all from me',\n",
       " '2012 Q1': \"I am Son. Thank you very much for coming today for the quarterly results announcement today, and I feel very good. In your life-time period, probably the same as a company, if you have a clear vision on mid-to-long term that will be really important for you and that's something that reminded me. We had a target to achieve operating income of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion by 2016. So, we have a numerical target and I believe we are in the path towards this target in accumulating the profit for that, which also explains that our progress of the business is making a good process so far, so that we have a strong determination to get the gold medal. So, those \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Olympic players that they aim for the gold medals, and I believe that they will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 regret to get the silver medal. That will make you further motivation to make full efforts to gain for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 go for the gold medal, and that's why that you can suffer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 well, you can sustain your efforts for the coming four years. From that said, I believe that having a clear vision and a clear numerical target is very important, and we are determined towards this target and we are making a clear path to it. And I believe that the content of today's presentation explains our step towards this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our target. Now, going to the presentation, in highlights, we have three highlights. Operating income; record high for seven consecutive periods. And second about steady growth in telecom service revenues. Note the one-time revenue increase from the handset sales or anything like that, but we have sustainable and a continuous telecom service revenue growth. And the third is implementation of interim dividend starting from this fiscal year. Now, going to the consolidated earnings results; net sales, as you can see the graph, making good progress; and also EBITDA. I believe this is the index that are mainly used and evaluate in the US and European countries. And that now that the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it again record high for nine consecutive periods with 12% increase. Operating income, 9% increase. Absolute figure for the operating income is now twice as much of that of KDDI, and at the same time that we're making closer steps towards the figure of DOCOMO. And operating income year-on-year compared to those two competitors, we are the only winner, making such results. And operating margin, this time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 first time this quarter we were able to exceed the operating margin of DOCOMO. When it comes to this type of infrastructure business, we still have a competitor with twice as much of customer base than \\xe2\\x80\\x93 usually, that company has a better operating margin due to the scale of the customer base, and I believe that's something that you are all familiar with. So, DOCOMO has quite a large amount of customer base, and then competing against that and we exceeded the DOCOMO's operating margin, and also we have more than twice as much of the operating margin of KDDI. KDDI, it actually have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has the more customer base than ours, but we exceed the operating margin of KDDI. Ordinary income; we have 20% increase. I will show you later in the later slides, but interest paid has been decreasing and that has been contributing to the results of ordinary income. Net income, the year-on-year basis, first quarter next fiscal year, we had a dilution gain from changes in equity interest mainly related to Renren, which is our group companies. So, there was a one-time gain. So, if we exclude this blue portion, which is this one-time gain, then we can say that it was the record high net income. And the summary of consolidated earnings results described in page 12, and here is the operating cash flow. And the breakdown of the cash flow, it's shown on page 14. Net interest-bearing debt compared to the time of peak, we've been reducing steadily. In the blue portion, this was the payment related to acquisition of preferred stocks issued to Vodafone Group. Even include that portion, still that we're making a very stable reduction of the net interest-bearing debt and maintaining the appropriate level of the net interest-bearing debt. Equity ratio also now hitting 20% in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from now on we believe that we'll be able to improve this equity ratio year-after-year. Interest expense, compared to the peak level, it became about one-third because SoftBank has a debt \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excess debt. And also about a few years ago that many people concerned about the debt volume of the SoftBank Corp, and people worry that our borrowings never be able to be repaid or something like that, but that was totally wrong assumption and that has been corrected and now that we've been able to reduce the interest expense to the one-third compared to the peak level. And starting from this interim period that we're going to make the interim dividend and that has resolved or we have resolved the direction of this dividend, interim dividend at the Board of Directors meeting so that we'd like to utilize this opportunity to enhance shareholders' return. And the business results; in a quarterly basis, the net subscriber additions, we have highest ever results here. Smartphone share-wise, our iPhone by SoftBank has better market share than KDDI's iPhone 4S, and this situation has been continued. This is a data coming from major electrics (sic) [electronics] retail stores. After au launched the iPhone, many people say that the people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 iPhone users of SoftBank may churn out or new iPhone users may go to the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 might go to the au, but that's totally wrong assumption. And the actual situation was in opposite way. Some media reported that large accounts of corporate users have churned SoftBank network, but the actual situation is that our churn ratio of the corporate users has been improving, and actually reducing the churn ratio of the corporate users. Tablet users' ratio, we are taking about 80% in maintaining this ratio. At the same time, number of corporate iPad customers, we have more than 70,000 companies. And as you can see, even accelerating the momentum of number of corporate iPad customers and making about 18 times in two years. A number of Google Apps IDs acquired. The applications for the corporate users, which is provided through cloud service, and we are becoming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we became number one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 global number one partner of Google Apps in selling the most number of the Google Apps ID. When it comes to WILLCOM, it perhaps suffered the bankruptcy, after then that we have become the supporter. And just about one year ago, starting from June last year, we start seeing the positive figures in WILLCOM, and since then, that it's keeping such a trend and now expanding its profitability. Number of users in WILLCOM, it's record-high since its reestablishment of the company. So, after \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right after joining to the SoftBank Group, it turned out the net additions, and at the same time making positive figures in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 being a healthy situation. And once we add WILLCOM users on top of the customer base, it's now recording 34.4 million, almost coming close to those cumulative numbers of users in au. At the time of Vodafone K.K., it was just about flat and no increase at all, and at the same time, suffering from the decrease in ARPU every months. That's why they're suffering from the decrease in profitability. But right after joining into SoftBank Group, that situation has drastically changed to the positive way and now making a record-high results continuously, and that is mainly contributed by this cumulative subscribers increase. And as mentioned earlier, we are targeting to record \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income by 2016. Once I said that, I definitely have to keep that promise. And how we're going to do that is explained here. As you saw this page earlier, there's two competitors keeping about the same operating income for past six years. But when it comes to SoftBank, we've been keeping our growth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 growing situation. I think there are lots of excuses I could make in the past such as spectrum that being allocated is different or a brand or sales distribution channels. There are lots of excuse that we can make, for example, termination of 2G network shutdown, handset inventories. Those could affect us, but without those excuses, we've been keeping our increase in operating income trend. It is very clear on this graph. And the biggest reason why for that is ARPU, which is our revenue per user was terribly low compared to those competitors at the time of Vodafone acquisition. So, at that time, our ARPU was about two-thirds of our competitors. But since then, we've worked hard to increase market share, and at the same time, we tried to increase ARPU. Because usually in order to gain more market share, you may need to cut your prices, but that was not the case with that. As you can see in this graph, we try not to cut our prices. We try to increase ARPU steadily, although that was slowly. But our competitors show different strength, especially KDDI for the past \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually, four years ago, KDDI's or au's ARPU was the highest in the market. But right now, au's ARPU is the lowest in this market. Their ARPU is now lower than ours. So, as this graph shows, it's to keep ARPU at the same level or increase ARPU takes a lot of effort. And management, of course, at \\xc2\\xa51 level or one penny level, ARPU could fall immediately, but it's harder to increase ARPU and it takes a lot of efforts. And it seems that au is having a hard time keeping ARPU from declining, and at the current rate, their ARPU could further go down from the current level. But that is not the case with SoftBank. We never offer the poor services. We try hard to keep the ARPU level and at the same time, try to grow our market share. So, as you can see on this graph, our competitors are losing their ARPU, but at the same time, we are keeping or even growing ARPU. So, we've been number one in terms of net addition of subscribers, but at the same time, we have been working hard to keep ARPU level or even increase ARPU. As a result of such efforts, our mobile telecom service revenue increased. And this time, the telecom service revenue increased 9% from a year earlier compared to our competitors, which recorded negative growth. We recorded positive growth of mobile telecom service revenue. ARPU has number or user in the result. That is very important. Every month, we keep track of net addition and we keep track of MNP every month. And such data appears on media or newspaper, but those \\xe2\\x80\\x93 index are just part of the business. What is important is ARPU and subscriber base, because subscriber \\xe2\\x80\\x93 number of subscriber time ARPU stimulates the telecom service revenue. So, again, we have been working hard to increase market share and increase subscribers and also keep ARPU at the same level or even grow. And that's why our mobile telecom service revenue has been increasing for the past years, while competitors are losing. And why, because our data revenue has been growing. Of course, competitors are seeing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 increasing data revenue recently, but our data revenue growth is offsetting the decrease of voice revenue. If the data revenue growth is smaller than voice revenue loss and the ARPU \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, mobile telecom service revenue will go down, and that's what's happening to our competitors. So, that's why that our competitors are showing the decrease of mobile telecom service revenue. It's really hard to keep mobile telecom service revenue while increasing subscriber base. But it is very important. And under the Vodafone K.K. control, the Mobile Communications business was losing mobile operating income every year. But once we acquired Vodafone K.K., the mobile operating income started to increase. And right now, it's about five times as much as when \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what it was six years ago. Not only in mobile business, but also we are working hard on fixed-line operating income as well. And in that sense, we are an exception even by global standards. Usually, the competitors in other companies are losing operating income in fixed-line business, although their \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though their mobile communications operating income is increasing, so that the mobile communication operating income growth cannot totally offset the fixed-line operating income. That's what's happening to other companies, but we are making income in fixed-line operating income. And as a result, we can generate \\xc2\\xa525 billion of fixed-line operating income in the quarter. Also, WILLCOM is increasing profit as well, and of course, Mobile Communications business is increasing operating income, and so is Fixed-Line Communications business. And Yahoo! Japan is also increasing operating income. Yahoo! Inc. in the United States is losing income every year. And their business model is getting obsolete. But Yahoo! Japan has been increasing operating income every year. So, the Yahoo! Japan is totally different than Yahoo! Inc. in the United States. Also the Yahoo! Japan has freshened up its management team with younger executives. And of course, that change in management grows some concern, but so far, the younger management or new management is not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has accelerate their operating income growth again. The management team is now 10 years younger than the former management. With the younger management team, the Yahoo! Japan is gaining momentum of operating income growth. So, the characteristics of SoftBank Group is making a steady growth in profit. So, to enhance our profit further, we are enhancing network towards future growth. We are going to upgrade our network infrastructure. When we acquired the mobile business from Vodafone K.K., the number of base stations were just 20,000, and a lot of people complained that the connectivity has never been improved even under the umbrella of SoftBank Group. Actually, the number of base stations have increased 10 times since the acquisition, and the number of Wi-Fi spots is by far larger than our competitors. Ours is 2.7 times as much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as many as au's, as you can see on this graph. Competitors are following suit with us by building Wi-Fi hotspots increasingly so that they can accommodate their increasing data traffic, so that they can offload the data traffic to Wi-Fi. But we realized the importance of Wi-Fi spots ahead of any other competitors, and we started taking measures on that ahead of competitors. The increase of Wi-Fi spots could result in the radio signal interference. Also, indoor, the Wi-Fi spots give good signal reception, but once the customer get out of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or get outside, then the signal is not working very well or the signal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Wi-Fi signal receptors could be retained in the handset. So, even after your customer get out of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 outside, the customer will have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 find it difficult to get stronger signal. And that issue \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's the issue we noticed. That was the issue we noticed through the experience of building Wi-Fi spots in many places and with that process, we find out that we had solution and we also got patent for that. If you climb the mountain ahead of others, from the top of the mountain, you can see the view, which ahead of any other people. And the view you can see from the top of the mountain is different than what the people in the middle of the mountain could see. Now, as we already implemented 4G LTE service, and NTT DOCOMO implemented Xi LTE service and KDDI is going to implement LTE service. KDDI implemented WiMAX service ahead of us, but we caught up with them already. And this page shows the theoretical communication speeds of services of different companies. The communication speeds were covered by media like newspapers and magazine. And they said that LTE gives us a faster service as optic fiber. But actually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the usual \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on a practical level, the multiple users access to the tower \\xe2\\x80\\x93 base station, so how many people are accessing or connecting to one base tower is the key to the speed. So, in that sense, the micro split \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or micro cells \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or implementing micro cells are really important. So, that's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the users on a base station will be reduced, that could lead to the faster speed. And according to the magazine Nikkei PC, which carried out experiment to measure the actual communication speed in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at congested area at Akihabara, Shinjuku and Yurakucho. And when they tested in Akihabara, the SoftBank 4G LTE service reached the speed of 34 mega bps. On the other hand, DOCOMO's LTE reached a speed of 2 mega bps and KDDI's WiMAX reached a speed of just 1 mega bps. This is the delta taken from the actual experiment by users. And of course, the number of users per cell or base station changes depending on time or place. But as you can see in this graph, our LTE service reached the fastest actual communication speed in these congested areas. So, our service can provide the fastest actual communication speed, and the reach of signals, why the people complained about SoftBank's connectivity before, but now that we acquired the license for platinum band and we have been working hard to prepare for the platinum band service, and actually platinum band service was launched in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on the 25th of July. But since then, public perception of the area coverage has been improving. Platinum band has been launched starting from July 25th of 2012. It's not all of the sudden nationwide coverage, but we are making a steady improvement and the conception is going on in everyday basis, so that the new base stations is launching everyday basis. This month, we are asked that the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this new spectrum damages the existing spectrum or not. If you migrate the traffic to the platinum band all of a sudden, then that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that, that will damage your \\xe2\\x80\\x93 congest the platinum band spectrum. So, that the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now that we are trying to have a minor adjustment little by little, so that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but at the same time, after the adjustment that we would like to increase drastically. By the end of this fiscal year, which is the end of March 2013, we would like to finish up the 16,000 base stations for the platinum band spectrum. And after then, which is fiscal year 2014, excuse me, 2013, ending March 2014, we would like to add 10,000 more base stations, so that in total we would like to make 26,000 base stations for the spectrum. And this rollout speed is by far fastest compared to the other countries, as for the construction phase. And we have TV commercials running and I believe that some of you have already seen it and once again, I'd want you to go through it. [Video Presentation] (32:52). So now that we're having good progress so far on this, starting from last year, we have already started the preparation for this construction, so last year, this year and the next year, so spending these three years, we would like to make an effort for this spectrum and having additional CapEx so that we will be able to improve the situations drastically. Going forward, I believe that we are entering into LTE era, TD and STE \\xe2\\x80\\x93 LTE, and we are expecting to launch from this fall. So, LTE for smartphones is going to be ready from this fall, and our price for that is \\xc2\\xa55,985 per month. So, having such CapEx, and at the same time having a better capability so that it is going to be more expensive than 3G price plan, but for the LTE \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the launch of this service. So, it's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we will make an effort to increase the data and also gain the better ARPU from the LTE service, because I believe that management's responsibility is to sustain the growth of the profitability. So, along this profitability increase, we also needs to develop the technology and expand the growth, then that we will be able to maintain the solid management for higher speed with more customer base that we would like to let them enjoy the data. And this will be the service that we're going to offer for those use, which is starting from this coming fall. So, I believe most of the people see a steady growth in our profitability. But some people may wonder can we sustain this profitability to reach the target of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, and you may ask about that question. And I will say we will keep our steady increase in data revenue to accumulate the profit. And now that we are about to enter the LTE-oriented market, up until last year, SoftBank was questioned that we may be behind compared to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 schedule compared to the other two. But once we launch, we believe that we'll be the fastest and also widest coverage for LTE service for the customers. So, I believe, service quality, service effective speed, from those several factors, we believe that we will be able to exceed the performance of competitors. So, I'm very much confident about that launch and the execution of the plan for the LTE, so that we would like to offer \\xc2\\xa55,980 per month, which is more expensive than 3G, but at the same time, that customers will enjoy higher speed with better quality. Once again, this is the responsibility for the management to make the company hitting the number one profit, so that we need to make steady steps towards this target, so that the key path of increase in profit to achieve this goal. Here again I want you to see the comparison with the global mobile operators in terms of operating income CAGR. Those six years from 2005 to 2011, this is the average growth of our operating income. Airtel, which is the number one player in India was 16%. America Movil, which is still number one in South America. Number one player in China, China Mobile was 10%. Those big players in the US, AT&T and Verizon, it was 2% or negative 5%. Number one player in European countries, Vodafone, was negative 1% and Telefonica, which developed in South America and European countries, was negative 7%. So, those players, which is playing as a number one in each continent, is actually showing the worst CAGRs in terms of operating income compared to SoftBank. So, we are making the best profit amongst those big operators. When you see in a different perspective, this is another view of operating income performance. Not only the average for six years, but also this graph shows the annual basis; some of the companies keeping flat or even suffering from the declines. On the contrary, we are making a sustainable growth in operating income. I think people can make many excuses as they want, but the result any such that we are making this steady growth in operating income. Why SoftBank is the only one that are making such growth using the same type of industry, same type of devices and others are making a steady or declines in operating income? Why can we do that? I think there are lots of reasons but if I must do, put it into the short words, well, then I believe because we are an Internet company. What I mean is, mobile has been transferring from the voice oriented to the Internet oriented. So the usage or the used case of the mobile device has been changed, totally shifted in the past six years. At the time of the acquisition of Vodafone K.K., I have received several questions from analyst at a press conference, why in this such matured market in Japan, why does SoftBank is now making acquisition of mobile company? And I said, that's not the right understanding because we are about to start the mobile Internet, and that is why that we are acquiring. It's not the end of the phase, but we are standing in the beginning of this phase towards the mobile Internet. That is why that we acquire this company, but at that time, I believed that most of the people really didn't get it, because that was before the launch of iPhone, so people didn't understand what the mobile Internet means. But telephone company looking at the mobile Internet is different from Internet company looking at the mobile Internet, and the view is totally different. And at the same time, strategy for that is totally different. As we have 960 mobile Internet companies in our group, so that our management and employees using Internet like we breathe and we speak using Internet, and we eat using Internet. So, that's something that we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 each of us knows how to utilize the Internet. So from that, people will be able to tell how should we structure the mobile communication platform or how should we design the device, how should we design the price plan, how should we design the service policies, because we are the Internet company, so that we can see from the Internet's perspective and build the mobile business model, and also can design the network from the viewpoint of mobile Internet. Sounds like very vague, but this is the most important. Maybe after the 30 years, IBM didn't really understand about PC. After 15 years, Microsoft didn't get what the Internet is. They are only the PC company, but not the Internet company. Compaq, who is the vendors for the PC hardware, Dell, HP, and also IBM in the past, they never be able to evolve themselves from the vendors of the PC. So, how you position your company and what will be the most important policy for your company is the key. And sounds like that is very vague and abstract, but at the same time that will be seen as the biggest difference of the results. And that can be seen also in Apple in US. They have developed the industries of PC and also developed the industry, building the platform, and being the very higher ranking of the market caps amongst the OS companies. We're still in behind compared to Apple, but spending 10 years, 20 years, we would like to make steady steps towards such company. So, that's how we position ourselves. So, we have this \\xc2\\xa51 trillion for the consolidated operating income and we are determined to achieve this target. And also, that means that we would like to maximize shareholders' value, and more importantly, that we would like to bring the happiness to people with Internet as a corporate philosophy, so happiness for everyone, we would like to expand and maximize profitability. That is all for my presentation. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " '2012 Q2': \"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. When I was small, the day before the athletic gymnastic field that I have very much excited. Even though that I am small guy, but I was really good at running. And whenever we have a running race, I was kind of the first guy. And of course whenever that I ran 50 meters or 100 meters, I was also excited, but the most excited part is the relay. So whenever that I will play that last runner of the relay, and whenever that I receive the baton, it's not always first place. Sometime that my prior runner comes in the third place or second place, so after I got the baton from the prior runner and see the front running players and I try to run before them and usually is a bigger guy than me, taller guy than me and I run and pass one-by-one, that is almost a very much exciting thing. Especially around the third corner and running in front of the others and then run as fast as I can and here the audience is so excited. So that is the biggest excitement that I remember in my early age. And to get such excitement that I have a lot of practice and I spend sleepless night before then. But the management, when it comes to the management of the business, there are lots of challenges that we have to face. It's not always good conditions or good environments, but under such circumstance and also with the competitive competitors and if you can pass them, and I think that is the most exciting things as from the management point of view, and even more exciting than the running race, so here that feeling such excitement that I would like to start my presentation here. Here are the highlights. Operating income exceeds \\xc2\\xa5400 billion, mobile business remains strong. iPhone 5 sales keep momentum. And the consolidated earnings results record high for three consecutive periods, 3% year-on-year increase in net sales. EBITDA is frequently used in European and U.S. countries and this is one of the most important key indicator for the financial point of view EBITDA. This is the operating income before earnings, before the interest, tax and depreciation. And we have record high for nine consecutive periods EBITDA and 11% year-on-year increase. In this EBITDA, \\xc2\\xa5591.9 billion shows that now that we are passing those competitors. EBIT, also 8% increase year-on-year, also the record high \\xc2\\xa5400 billion operating income or EBIT is almost a full year EBIT of the competitors. So we made six months results, so this is something that I am proud of. So all of our employees' efforts put in into these results. And because this is a competition, so there are lots of situation change and also each company has their own reason. So under such circumstance, without any excuse that we be making a record high operating income. And now closing in on DOCOMO for the first half. So they were on 471 EBIT and now that we are in very close to them and ready to pass them. So we are the only one in the industry that we are making a good growth, steady growth in EBIT. And when it comes to EBIT margin, we completely become number one in Japan, 25% in SOFTBANK. So it's almost twice as much of KDDI's EBIT margin. And going forward, it's not only Japan but also we need to do the comparison with U.S. companies, U.S. operators as well. So here is a comparison with AT&T and Verizon. And they are 20% or 19% respectively and compared to that we are hitting 25%. So even in a comparison in U.S. market and Japan market, that we are steadily keeping number one position. And the ordinary income 15% increase in year-on-year. And the net income, for last year we had a one-off increase due to the impact of Renren Inc. IPO and also had an impact of transferring Yahoo! Inc. shares. So taking that out of the one-off increase, coming from the core business which has also remained stable. And here is a summary of consolidated earnings results. Operating cash flow, again we got high for four consecutive periods, 20% year-on-year increase. Free cash flow and others as you can see on the slide here. Now net interest bearing debt used to have about two point some trillion yen right after the acquisition and it's making a steady reduction. And we had a payment related to acquisition of preferred stocks et cetera issued to Vodafone Group. So if we take this part, if we only see the pure net interest bearing debt, it's now \\xc2\\xa50.4 trillion even that we include this payment, it's still \\xc2\\xa50.6 trillion for net interest bearing debt. As a result, interest expense is making substantial reduction and now almost one-third. Equity ratio is now hitting 20%, a significant improvement has been made. So making large borrowings and acquired Vodafone K.K. So six years ago, there were lots of concerns amongst the market and also lots of people who have criticized at us. About six years later, now that the management condition has been very much improved. As a result, dividend's also increased. So starting from this fiscal year that we made interim dividends paid out and also going to make the year-end dividend as well. So business in Japan, the other day that iPhone 5 has been launched and there are some misunderstandings or rumors coming around and I pick-up two typical misunderstandings. One of which is that iPhone standby time on au's LTE is approximately 260 hours, for SOFTBANK its 160. Whereas, in the beginning and now that we have improved the battery runs out time, so starting from 19th of last month that we have been having a several setting change and the optimizations. So as of today, iPhones of SOFTBANK battery last longer than au's. One another misunderstanding, the SOFTBANK's LTE omni mini cell base stations. So even though that we increased the number of base stations but because of the omni cell, so only one antenna can cover 360 degree. So that's the one expression was made by certain person. So from this person's point of view that the number of base station, how much we increase, but it doesn't make sense, but as a matter of fact we also adopt three sector type and having three antennas to proper signals. And there are some part that have a gap or hotspot, those areas there we use the omni cell so that we can effectively cover the hotspot. So we use the three sector antennas and mainly 97% of our LTE base stations are sector type antenna. And all the gaps were filled by omni cell type antennas. So I clarified some typical misunderstandings here today. SOFTBANK iPhone might be selling slowly but actually that's what some people are saying. But actually, the SOFTBANK iPhone sales is outperforming our rival. And an MNP statistics or handsets or some customers actually there are a lot of benchmark to measure the company's performance but what's the most important performance indicator that is profits. But how can we increase profits? Well we can increase profit by revenue increase but revenue consists of number of subscribers and ARPU. So number of subscribers time ARPU equals to revenue. Now let's look at subscribers. When it comes to net subscriber addition, we are overwhelmingly number one. MNP is just one area of looking at subscriber base but what is more important to look at is the total number of subscribers and how much ARPU can be generated from such subscribers. Now in terms of net subscribers addition we are overwhelmingly number one. Now when it comes to ARPU or Average Revenue Per User. When we acquired Vodafone K.K., ARPU was by far lower than in the industry. And at that time, six years ago, the connectivity was poor. But, so when we took over the mobile business from Vodafone K.K., the ARPU was the lowest and the connectivity was far less. But we tried hard to catch up and tried to get ahead of competitors. And as you can see here, our ARPU trend has been on the upward trend. However competitors although they had advantages over SOFTBANK when we acquired Vodafone K.K. but actually their ARPU trend has been on the declining trend. So to increase revenue it's important to increase the number of subscribers and also it's important to increase ARPU. We are the only operator which has been increasing revenue steadily and increasing profits steadily. And even by global standards we are by far better in terms of revenue increase, even compared with Chinese operators and European operators and American operators. So our mobile EBIT is this. When we took over the Vodafone K.K., our mobile business was far behind the rivals. But right now I mean since then, the acquisition, since acquisition, we had catch-up with -- caught up with competitors and now getting ahead of competitors. So let me remind you of this formula. The revenue is defined by the number of subscribers and ARPU. So we made the biggest growth in terms of subscriber and ARPU, as ARPU increased by far larger rate. And our EBIT growth is at the highest rates compared to any other operators in Japan and in the world. Now WILLCOM, WILLCOM went bankrupt, but once we took over the WILLCOM's business, and since then the WILLCOM subscriber base has been expanding. And WILLCOM has been renewing the records of number of subscribers' every month and WILLCOM's profit has been increasing every month. We didn't lay-off any WILLCOM's employees after. And the Japanese companies were famous for not laying off people, that was in the past. Recently, even major Japanese companies are cutting workforce these days, but SOFTBANK didn't layoff any of WILLCOM's employees. SOFTBANK acquired many companies but for the past 30 years SOFTBANK never laid off employees of acquired companies. Another example is former Japan Telecom. Japan Telecom was in the fixed line communications business. Now once we acquired Japan Telecom to run our fixed line business that fixed line communications segment has been increasing its profit. So when it comes to EBIT, fixed line business EBIT, the SOFTBANK's fixed line business segment marking the highest EBIT growth rate even in the world. So compared with other fixed line businesses in the world, the SOFTBANK's fixed line businesses, its EBIT increase is the highest and EBITDA margin, right, while NTT has been protected by the government because NTT used to be a state owned company. So in that sense, NTT had enjoyed the dominating position in the market. However our fixed line business has been recording the growing EBIT margin as well, which is by far larger than NTTs margin growth rate. Another Group company, Yahoo! JAPAN. Now Yahoo! Inc. in United States is recording a fluctuating income profit, but Yahoo! JAPAN has been increasing operating income every year. So we have Yahoo! under umbrella and we have fixed line business and we have a PHS business, they are in a different sector of business but they have one commonality which is that they are growing profit every year once they are under SOFTBANK's umbrella. Yahoo! JAPAN is growing income unlike their U.S. counterparts, Yahoo! Inc. Now the other day we announced a deal with Sprint and a lot of people said that SOFTBANK is going to heavily indebted it and SOFTBANK is taking a big risk. But some people said that SOFTBANK could do more about improving network and signal reception, so why doesn't SOFTBANK do more about the network instead of making inroads to the United States. And actually I got lot of such comments in our Twitter account. No worries. That's something that I would like to tell our customers. We will continuously improve our network. So our original plan for the base stations of Platinum Band, which has been submitted to ministry as well. So usually you submit the plan, but actual is this a plan that's often happens case, but ours are not. We actually accelerate the schedule and make it faster and a better network building is now conducted. As a result, consolidated CapEx that the spending in U.S. now the people may concern that we are going to run out of cash in Japan, but that's not true. We actually even progressing in ahead of schedules for the CapEx as well. So we have accelerated CapEx for this in the next fiscal year and the \\xc2\\xa5700 billion is the accelerated schedule. And also next fiscal year also going to increase by \\xc2\\xa5100 billion to \\xc2\\xa5550 billion, so that we are not ignoring Japanese market or Japanese quality of communication, we are not postponing any of our network improvement, and we are not sacrificing Japanese market because of the investment in U.S. As a matter of fact that we will be making our accelerated schedule, and also we're making a good result also in the first half already, so that we will be able to enhance the CapEx in domestic market as well. So that going into U.S. market is not sacrificing Japanese market, that's something that I would like to tell to the customers. So Platinum Band that's it, but how about LTE, that will be the next question. So as for the LTE question, there are another rumor that I heard. SOFTBANK LTE base station probably that we are planning to have a lot. However, most importantly, Yamanote-line which is the most popular areas that the people hear and whenever the people get on in a train and measure the coverage of the Yamanote-line stations. And they had 24 stations available in au and six stations in SOFTBANK probably back then in October the 9th, that could be the case. However, we're already catching up. And just about this noon that we have already achieved, just about this noon that we have achieved remaining of the three stations has been activated. So now that the 29 stations versus 29 stations, so we all covered Yamanote-line stations now. So that any stations in Yamanote-line and that you will be able to receive the signals in LTE. So that we've been checking all the stations with handset of SOFTBANK and au and we confirmed that we have all coverage available. So we are catching up with the Yamanote-line and are we satisfied enough? Wait, no. Yamanote-line, probably we are a little bit behind in terms of coverage, but when we see the nationwide, probably we are better. So that's why we've been researching this weekend and with that the employees check the 1000 stations of the Japan Railway. So this is the top 1,000 Japan Railway company stations by commuter numbers and I let our employees go there and check all the coverage. It was last Friday that I said so. And spending their weekends on Saturday and Sunday and all the 1000 stations has been surveyed by commuter numbers. Shinjuku, Ikebukuro and so on to Kaga Onsen or some of the stations that I don't know. So including all those stations of the 1000 in Japan Railway. So it's not we specifically selected stations, but this is the stations by commuter numbers. And as a result, you see, we have covered 807 stations versus au in 542. So this is something that the competition is beautiful about. So because we have a competition that's why that we do our best, we put our effort. So it's not a monopoly, but there is a competitions, it's not a government owned or state owned company. So that's why that we have motivated to work on weekends; Saturdays and Sundays. So there are lots of excuse that we would like to make, but still that we don't say that, but we just put an effort to make it happen. So here these result, 807 stations versus 542. So LTE coverage that we have very good, not only the good coverage but also speed. So with this 1000 stations, we also measure the speed of the LTE. And now that we found out that the 674 stations that we are faster than the au of 218 stations. So we are overwhelmingly providing the faster speed, so coverage as well as speed. Why I'm saying that is because, last week we made a questionnaire survey in asking customers how do you think about LTE coverage of SOFTBANK and do you think that the speed is fast. And the actual image was really not winning over au. So people's reception of SOFTBANK's LTE service is slow and not wide enough, so that's the kind of the reception that a lots of people have about the SOFTBANK's LTE. So that's not really true, so that's why that we made such a survey to make sure that we are not such. In the average of the speed, in 1000 top Japan Railway company stations by commuter numbers, so in average speed, we made a average sounding speed of 5.8 mega bps versus 3.4 in au. So those areas are not providing -- receiving the LTE reception than that we compare based on the 3G. So it's apple-to apple comparison. And with the apple-to-apple comparison and a comparison of this average speed, we made better results. So it's fast and also wider coverage. On top of that, we have EMOBILE acquisition. We have -- 1.7 gigahertz will be available in sometime in few months on top of out of 2.1 gigahertz. Therefore that we'll be able to even enhance the LTE coverage. So even in the same iPhone 5, this is a global band, so that the 2.1 gigahertz and also 1.7 gigahertz will be available as a global standard band. So that those signals can be received in iPhone 5, so that we can improve the LTE connection. And hereon is the focus for consolidated results. In full year, consolidated EBIT exceeding 700 billion target will be kept -- remain same, unchanged. In continuing revenue and profit increase and in 2016, fiscal 2016 we're setting the target of hitting \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in Japan business on the -- of course in coming years, we are going to add Sprint's results to others. But even without those additions, only in Japanese business, we like to keep the target for \\xc2\\xa51 trillion for the consolidated EBIT. So for the further growth, so far, SOFTBANK of course focused on Japanese market, but from now on, not only Japanese market, but also Chinese companies and the Asian companies are becoming a profitable company now. There are rapidly growing companies there as well. That we're expecting that we will be able to receive the contribution from such companies. In addition to that, customer base or number of users that we are already hitting 1.5 billion, so this year that we would like to increase furthermore on the customer base. So in addition to the Asian market, now that we're seeing U.S. market and after the announcement of the strategic partnership that we're receiving a lot of questions about this and I would like to pick-up the typical questions that I received. First one is, why U.S.? Because the U.S. market is making remarkable growth and sustainable growth is expected. So we are aiming for sustainable growth in a country with a fast growing mobile market. While Japanese market is suffering from the declining birth rate and aging, but U.S. population is expected to grow to 400 million and U.S., the GDP of the United States is expected to grow farther to $38.3 trillion. And Japan and United States are global leaders in LTE and when it comes to the data traffic, Japan and the United States are the leaders in the world. But what about the country risk of the United States? There are many countries in Asia and there are lot of countries in Europe, but in my view, the United States is one of the countries with lowest country risk in the world. So that's why we are making inroad to the United States. But why Sprint? Because we see high growth potential in Sprint for three reasons: First of all, the revenue would increase, and number two; we expect the financial position to improve and management efficiency is also expected. Again this formula, subscribers time ARPU equals to revenue. Number of subscribers last week or maybe this week, Sprint announced the earnings result. And according to the result, the number of subscribers decreased and some people are worried about that, but actually please look at this. The yellow highlighted portion represent the Sprint, the users on Sprint platform and the gray bars represents the subscribers on Nextel platform and Nextel has been providing the transceiver like service. The transceivers you have seen them warehouse or outdoor and that the service is called push-to-talk and Nextel is a provider of push-to-talk service but that service is becoming outdated. So that service will be shut down next year, that was already announced. So that service will discontinue from June next year. So there is no point of acquiring Nextel customers. Instead, the Sprint is focusing on migrating Nextel customers to the new platform because the Nextel's push-to-talk service will discontinue next year. So I would like to ask you to look at yellow highlighted portion. If the yellow portion is showing the declining trend, that's not good, but actually the number of customers on the Sprint platform has been increasing steadily and when it comes to the change in subscribers year-on-year, and this graph shows the combined total of Sprint platform customers and Nextel platform customers. And the growth of subscriber year-on-year is 4.8% which is almost same as AT&T and Verizon. But when it comes to the subscriber growth, of those on the Sprint platform, the growth rate of this is 14.0% which is by far larger than AT&T and Verizon. So, when it comes to the number of subscribers, Sprint is in good shape. Another important element, ARPU. The Sprint is recording a growing ARPU for the past years. And here is the ARPU growth rate. As you can see here, the Sprint ARPU growth rate is by far larger. So the number of subscriber has been increasing in the largest growth rate, and the ARPU is also growing at the largest growth rate. Now, the revenue growth rates. It's almost same as their competitors. If we add the Sprint and Nextel revenue, but if you look at the Sprint platform, the revenue from the Sprint platform only, again the revenue growth rate is by far larger. So, so far the Sprint has been seen as cash strapped company, but actually Sprint is in the turnaround stage and the turnaround has begun. So it's been rebounding. And that rebounding trend has just started. So, and the consolidated net operating revenue has been growing at the largest rate than other, compared to other companies. So that's why, I see a huge opportunity in revenue increase. Now second one, the financial position. Well so far, again the Sprint platform wide, there is a rebounding trend. But again the Sprint has been cash strapped. But we are going to invest in Sprint $8.1 billion. As a result, the Sprint net debt will go down sharply and as a result, interest expense would increase as well. As a result, the net debt EBITDA multiple will go down sharply. Before capital increase, the multiple was 3.13 times, but after the capital increase because of our investment, the multiple will go down to 1.46 times. So the Sprint can spend a CapEx for the further growth. Even with small CapEx, the Sprint has been on the rebounding trend or turnaround trend, but with additional cash and additional CapEx spending, the further growth is expected. Also the management efficiency will be -- is expected to improve. Now actually here in this room the Sprint CFO and other management team member, we have Sprint management team member here. And yesterday and today we had a meeting with them to have brainstorming and we know that we can learn many things from their practice. And through the brainstorming session, the Sprint team said that they could learn from SOFTBANK practices. So through the brainstorming session, we learn each other about the practices. So, so far the Sprint EBITDA margin has been on the declining trend, but that could be turning around. When the SOFTBANK acquired Vodafone K.K., the EBITDA margin was low, but that has been increasing since our acquisition. And SOFTBANK is number one in the U.S. and in Japan when it comes to EBITDA margin. So the SOFTBANK's expertise and know-how could be adopted by Sprint, so that Sprint could accelerate its turnaround process and growth process. So when we took over the Vodafone's mobile business in Japan. And since then the mobile business has been growing. So this V shape recovery is expected in Sprint as well. So the Sprint EBITDA margin will grow further. When you buy something at the highest price and then later on if the value goes down, that's not a good investment. And it's good to buy at a low price and make it grow is good. But actually we... But well before the turnaround that we actually invested in and also accelerate this turnaround is kind of the way that we should. So recently there is some mass media coverage talking about the negative figures about Sprint and there was worse on the media. However in reality this is true in a sense however if you look closer, actually this Nextel service is now scheduled to shutdown in the June next year and has been announced to do so. What Sprint doing is that accelerated depreciation for this asset. So actually this is still the available assets, however because of the shutdown on Nextel platform that this is depreciated accelerated way. So still on the balance sheet but depreciated in accelerated way, so that actually making a bigger negative effect more than reality. So this Nextel equipment effect, if we take that out from the -- then actually we are showing a profit. And also net loss is not that large, as a matter of fact if we take into the account of the acceleration of depreciation in Nextel platform, and also there is a burden on the interest payments here as well. And once, as I mentioned earlier, once that you improve the balance sheet, so that you would be able to have a better interest and also the amount itself is going to be reduced. It means that I believe that you will be able to see that big turnaround after then. So now that they are hitting bottom and coming back to the positive direction and that's very timing that we invest -- making an investment and joining in. So that was a very good timing as a matter of fact I believe. So now that having a big borrowing and probably a lot of SOFTBANK shareholders complains or concerns about the situation dictate again. So maybe you're going to bankrupt again, that's a kind of the concerns that some shareholders may have. So now that I'd like to share with you what is the real capability of SOFTBANK and what is the SOFTBANK share strength. So you see that we had a big debt at the time of acquisition of Vodafone, that has been reduced rapidly and also the operating income has made an incredible improvement. But at the same time this time after the announcement we made a big drop in the share price, and actually that the market cap is about the same as our competitor KDDI, as of the today's closing price. As mentioned earlier, our profit has already been grown by twice as much, but the market cap is about the same as our competitor au. So as of the October 30th closing price, it was \\xc2\\xa52,508 and this is a target price by analysts and actually that mostly bullish or buy. So that it's not -- some people worried, but most of the analyst is setting a target higher than the yesterday's closing price and also recommending to buy. So here are the analyst comments. I would like to say myself, but I just borrowed the words by the analyst and put in here. There is growth expectations, highly expected and also there was no meaningful concern and also it's a historical trading opportunity, that was another comment made by the analyst which made me happy. So actually, that I am the runner, and they are the audience around the course, then I with those good comments that probably I can run even faster. So with such good comments, then that I will be even more motivated to run faster. Here as a result consolidated EBITDA, now that the exceeding KDDI very much close to DOCOMO right now. So having additions here that we will be exceeding and surpassing DOCOMO. So acquisition is not really your own capability and some people may say so, but still win is win. If we win the game, that's the result. So of course it's not always a good thing, sometimes the risk comes alone. So that, but still that we have already made good results in EBITDA as well. So here is the SOFTBANK's enterprise value. Our sales compared with the global operator, mobile operator now positioned in number three, which I also mentioned in a previous announcement. When it comes to mobile EBITDA, global number five. Growth rate or CAGR, number one in the world. So we are making biggest growth, and also sales in number three and EBITDA number five. However, when you see the mobile operator's market cap, we are in number 38. So it's a \\xc2\\xa51.1 trillion market cap now. So SOFTBANK's market cap, maybe people may just wonder is that the 2.8 or something, why it's 1.1? It's because we have Yahoo! JAPAN, Alibaba and other Internet related company shares, we have about 1.7 trillion in total. So that value is taking up from 2.8. Then only looking at the telecom business market cap, which gives us about 1.1. So EBITDA \\xc2\\xa51 trillion for the telecom business and market cap is seen here. So we have lots of debt, but when you see the average market cap or by EBITDA multiple, it is about 4.5 times and we are one times which is too low. Of course we have a debt and this is something happened in the time of acquisition of Vodafone K.K. and over the six years, we've been reducing such debt. So here going forward, five to six to seven years, if we will be able to bring the level to the appropriate level while reduce our debt. Then I believe that our market cap will be equivalent to the major global operator. So it's just a time matter and we're expecting that we're going to be about the same level as the other global operator because we are making the number one growth ratio. And with all that, so I've been having strong motivations about the expansion of the business base and people may ask me why expanding, keep expanding business base? And because we would like to have a robust management base by enhancing the financial strength, so that we will be able to provide the best possible service to the customers, so that handset device network, that's something that we would like to provide the best. And so that we need to have a robust base to provide such services. Any equipment vendors, maybe they only focus on Japanese market, but just give them to left alone in the world, then that you will never be able to have strength enough to compete against the global market or global company. If you don't have such strength, then you'll never be able to win the game in Japanese market either, so that you have to have a continuous profit and continuous growth, then that you have strength over the CapEx. And also as a result that you will be able to provide better service to the customer. So if you only focus on Japanese market, and try to make a small base and focus small but beautiful, but I don't believe so. That's not really fit into the management style or concept. So you have to be able to compete against the global market or global companies. In the past, Japanese vendors are making the most suitable handset for the Japanese customers, and only focusing on the Japanese users and they believed that the Japanese users were most advanced users in compared to the market. But as a matter of fact, that they later found out that we were only left alone compared to the rest of the world. And became the Galapagos phone. So the global band LTE and the smartphone is now that are making the best advantage. So that you just be in a small world, the goldfish in a very small bowl. So that's not good. You have to go to the big ocean and swim there. So that's the kind of the concept that we have. So we have to take a risk and go over to the big ocean. So that could sounds like crazy and maybe very risky, which we realize that. And we know that, but knowing that still that we would like to take the risk to go for it because we need to be the global base devices and a global network. So everything is becoming global standard, and there that we have to take an advantage of the scale of the economy. So as a result, we can provide the cutting edge LTE network, the global level, a global smartphone and innovative services for Japanese consumers and the consumers in United States. And we'd like to bring about lifestyle innovations through mobile internet and also we try to bring about information revolution, happiness for everyone, that's our corporate philosophy and we are pursuing it\",\n",
       " '2012 Q3': \"My name is Son. Thank you very much for coming today. So recently, I've been thinking that, so once we have passion, which is very important I think. At the time we decided to acquire Vodafone K.K., I thought we have to win over the competitors some time later. That's something that I made a comment at the time of acquisition. And back then our customer number was about 16 million and the revenue and the profit was not enough and not operating income. Vodafone K.K. was actually declining one after another. So that was the situation. And also, ARPU was declining at the same time. So SoftBank was just about profitable \\xe2\\x80\\x93 became profitable after the investment in broadband. It was about the time that we are going to expand the profitability. However, we had a big vision at that time and decided and determined ourselves to become number one or to overcome \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to win over the number one company in the industry as far as we are entering into the market. And remember that there was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we were far behind. However, with this earnings results, forecast of operating income is going to be announced during this my presentation. And even under the Japan GAAP, we are targeting \\xc2\\xa5800 billion in domestic consolidated operating income for the next fiscal year. As you know that the DoCoMo's operating income has been flat for past six years and is about a little bit of over \\xc2\\xa5800 billion every year basis. And this year, it has been announced that their operating income was around \\xc2\\xa5820 billion. And in next fiscal year with domestic consolidated operating income, we believe and determine to exceed DoCoMo's operating income. Customer number, even though that we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is kind of combined with WILLCOM and EMOBILE, in addition to that, we have announced the acquisition of Sprint, so exceeding 40 million in domestic market and assuming that we're adding Sprint's customer number that would be bringing us to close to 100 million in near future. And next \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the next fiscal year around, which is the fiscal 2013, the period ending March 30 in 2014, we will be closing in on DoCoMo's in terms of operating income, and also customer number-wise, we will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 become the number one. So acquiring the Vodafone K.K., at the time of entering into this market, we thought that the way to become number one is too long. And we were not sure back then that when we will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even be able to reach to that target. However, with the strong passion we had and with a strong determined mind, we have challenged so many things and that brought us to the steady steps towards the target and now that we believe we'll be able to reach there. It's not what you have, but actually, it's what you determined is actually more important to bring the things come true. So now I would like to go into my presentation. As I mentioned earlier, this is the highlights for earnings results. With the nine-month period, we have exceeded \\xc2\\xa5600 billion operating income, which is 13% increase year-on-year. In domestic market, we have achieved 40 million lines target. And now the more details. Net sales, 5% increase. EBITDA or the operating income before the depreciation and amortization, actually this EBITDA is more importantly treated as an indicator for the financial status, especially when you have by M&As. There are several companies which have a different accounting treatment, so mainly EBITDA becomes a key role to compare the performance of the business. And here with this EBITDA, we have recorded 15% increase and \\xc2\\xa5890 billion in nine-month period and operating income, as mentioned earlier, surpassed \\xc2\\xa5600 billion with 13% increase. So the latest quarter from September to December, excuse me, October to December, the latest quarter wise, this was 24% increase in operating income. In the full year nine months period, 13% increase so that we're actually accelerating the growth rate of operating income under such circumstance. Operating income in nine months period comparing with the competitors, we're making a steady pace of increasing in operating income and closing in on competitors. Again, as is, obviously, comparison with competitors, as you can see that the competitor is showing only little increase or the negative figure, but we made a 13% growth rate because the mobile is very much CapEx heavy business, so economy of scale has a big influence into the profitability operating margin. So we are smaller than DoCoMo in terms of economy of scale, but actually that we have exceeded two competitors in Japan in terms of operating margin which, I believe, is a very good news and happy news for us. In addition, from this year with the proper process and stimulus process in the regulatory and the administrative work that we will be able to exceed the competitors in the U.S. market as well and which also is showing a steady increase level in operating margin. And also the EBITDA margin, we recorded 52% so that exceeded the 50% level first time. So that even compared to competitors we are making better progress. Ordinary income, we have record high for four consecutive periods with 19% increase. Net income, last year it happens to be we had some factors for the one-time gains such as the impact from IPO of Renren and also the impact from sales of Yahoo! So those are the one-time gains in last fiscal year. So if we exclude those one-time gain and look at the organic growth, we have been making a steady growth and at the same time this is the record high excluding such one-time gains. And here it shows the summary of consolidated earnings results. Operating cash flow is also showing steady progress so far. Cash flow breakdown shows in this slide. Net interest bearing debt also making steady reduction and this time we had acquisition of Sprint corporate bonds, but if we exclude that, it's making a steady decrease in net interest bearing debt. More importantly, multiple is a key which is the net debt over EBITDA and how healthy it is for the company and that shows in this slide which is 0.7 times for our case in multiple. Just for your reference, AT&T, Verizon, those are very good blue-chips. They are about 1.7 times,, it's like 1.5 times or so. So compared to those companies, we are actually better in net debt to EBITDA multiple even including leases, it's 1.3 times. Along with the acquisition of Sprint, US$20 billion financing has been completed and structured under facility A and B. And we've been seeing that the foreign exchange rates changing and if, as of today, if we decided to finance the exchange rate as of today, then that's going to give us about \\xc2\\xa591 per dollar, but fortunately we have already made a rapid action and we were expecting that the exchange rate may change so that we have decided to put the forward exchange rate so that the whole total amount of US$20 billion. We had a forward exchange rate with \\xc2\\xa582.2 per dollar. So suppose that if we purchase in as of today's yen then that's going to make a difference of over \\xc2\\xa5200 billion so that's \\xc2\\xa5200 billion cheaper in terms of financing for us This is very much fortunate for us and that's it, but at least we could say that we were able to hedge the risk with the exchange rate already. The substantial gain from there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the net income. Haven't seen any recording. I was reading those bulletin boards on Yahoo! and showing the net income including that \\xc2\\xa5200 billion deemed gain, but that does not include in our net sales. That's just a misunderstanding on the writer on the bulletin board, I believe. So that this has no anythings included in the net income, but substantially or the deemed gain is the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that amount, so compared with \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just a comparison with the today's amount for the exchange rate. And dividend policy, we have no change in dividend policy. And along with this Sprint acquisition, we have decided to adopt international financial reporting standards also known as IFRS. And recently from the international investors we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they have been showing the interest of our company, and to provide the appropriate measurement using the international standard will be the better tools for the investors to compare the companies. So that is why that we have decided to adopt international financial reporting standards from now on from the fiscal year 2013 in the first quarter. So now that I would like to go into the status of each business in Japan. As I said earlier, in Japan, our number of subscribers hit 40 million mark. We announced the target in October 2010 and we achieved the target, 40 million lines. Back in 2010, we had only a bit over 20 million lines and we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our target was that within 10 years from 2010, we will achieve 40 million subscribers, but within just two years, we achieved the target. Of course, we added the WILLCOM's subscribers and EMOBILE subscribers. But anyway, we achieved the 40 million subscriber target. Now, look at the SoftBank brand mobile business, we have been recording net addition number one for years and for the past \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from the April to December period, we have recorded number one in net additions. For the five consecutive years, we have been number one in net additions and we are proud of that. About iPhone 5, when KDDI joined us in selling iPhone, a lot of people believed that SoftBank will lose its ground to au or KDDI, but we have been number one in terms of iPhone sales in Japan, and actually the gap between iPhone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, SoftBank and KDDI has been growing since the iPhone 5 launch. Our subscriber net addition is number one in this market. Not only that, but also ARPU or average revenue per user has been increasing. Our competitors have seen the constant decline of ARPU. There is no sign of improvement so far. But that is not the case with SoftBank. It took us two years for us to reverse the declining ARPU trend. Vodafone saw the sharp decline of ARPU in the past and the ARPU recorded by Vodafone K.K. was \\xc2\\xa51,000 or more lower than its competitors. But two years after our acquisition of Vodafone K.K., ARPU declining trend was reversed and then since then our ARPU has been increasing. SoftBank maintained number one position in terms of net additions. At the same time, the SoftBank managed to revise the declining trend of ARPU. That's easy to say but not easy to get done, but we managed to do that. We have achieved the reversal of the ARPU declining trend, and that's why our revenue has been growing. Just increasing subs, subscribers is not working to increase the revenue if the ARPU is decreasing, but we increased number of subscribers and at the same time we increased number of ARPUs, and that's why our revenue has been growing at the fastest pace even in the world. And that increase of data revenue is significant, it's 17% year-on-year increase and that's on \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so again, the ARPU has been increasing and that's why our mobile service revenue increased 9% year-over-year. Competitors said that their revenue \\xe2\\x80\\x93 their MNP port-in increased or things like that, but actually, the key is revenue and revenue is number of subs times ARPU. And we are number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are better than competitors when it comes to number of subscribers, ARPU and amount of revenue. And as a result, our EBITDA margin has been increasing, and right now our EBITDA margin is number one in the world. Usually, the company would scale enjoy the higher margin rates. There are many companies bigger than SoftBank, but when it comes to EBITDA margin, ours is higher even so our business is only in Japan for now and our scale is smaller than other companies, still the SoftBank's EBITDA margin is the highest in the industry around the world. Global number one, maybe the telecom operator in smaller country have recorded better EBITDA margin, but when compared to the operators in key markets, the SoftBank's EBITDA margin is better than any other companies. Our revenue growth rate is number one and our margin growth rate is number one in the world. In China, the number of the subscribers have been growing and the same goes to India and Latin American countries. But still even with the smaller subscriber base, our margin rate is growing faster. When the Vodafone K.K. lost their operating income every year, but once the Vodafone K.K. was acquired by SoftBank then the mobile business has reversed the trend of declining revenue. So, again, our net addition grew faster than any other competitors and ARPU has been growing. And our ARPU will become number one within a year or two. Our number of subscriber has been growing. Not only that, but also we will record the highest ARPU in Japan, maybe, next fiscal year which is fiscal 2013 at the current pace. And as a result, the telecom service revenue will grow faster than other competitors. About WILLCOM which went bankrupt. Once WILLCOM came under SoftBank's umbrella, the subscriber trend reversed. One month after the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after it become part of the SoftBank group, WILLCOM has been increasing its subscribers every month and the record subscriber \\xe2\\x80\\x93 number of subscriber is renewing records every month and the profitability has been increasing. And right now, the subscriber has their record high number of subscribers and that record has been renewed every month. Even in the fixed-line communications business, the profitability has been improving and the income has been increasing as well every year. For the past nine months, our fixed-line operating income was \\xc2\\xa581.1 billion, and the fixed-line operating income growth rate is also number one in the world. That's phenomenal. And there a lot of other fixed-line communication operators with larger scale in the world, they have larger subscriber base, but our operating income amount and operating income growth rates are higher than other companies. So we are determined to achieve growth and we work hard. And that attitude and passion and determination produced the results. Now Google Apps. We are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we sold the largest number of Google Apps IDs in the world to a lot of major companies or large companies. Once Google Apps are implemented in companies, the 70% of corporate customers, nearly 70% of the corporate customers are subscribed for our mobile service. We have built a lot of expertise and we have worked hard and we made a lot of effort. As a result we have acquired a lot of consumers as our customers, but at the same time we have acquired a lot of enterprise customers and Yahoo Japan which is another important group company and Yahoo Japan's profit growth has been accelerating. Management was reshuffled last year to the younger management team, but still the operating income keeps growing, so the young management team is proud of that because our founding management made a great result, but that was taken over \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that track record was taken over by the young management team and right now Yahoo Japan has been accelerating its profit growth. I'm really proud of that. So the old management handed over the management \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Yahoo Japan's management to the younger management team. It's not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's easy to say but it's not easy to get done, but Yahoo Japan's young management team, younger management team is fulfilling its responsibility so far. Another thing I'd like to mention is this, the application sales for smartphone, especially for Android devices, one of our group company, GungHo is making a Smartsheet, produced a Smartsheet game application, Puzzle & Dragons. In terms of sales, the Puzzle & Dragons is number one in the world. My younger brother is part of the management team of GungHo and SoftBank has a stake, a 33.7% stake in the company. SoftBank is the largest shareholder of GungHo. And the GungHo's game Puzzle & Dragons is number one in terms of sales among the Android devices. And for the iPhone, the same game is number one in sales. One month ago, it was ranked number five in the world and in December it was ranked third in the world among the iPhone. And I expect that the Puzzle & Dragons for iPhone or iOS device will become number one in the world. So combined total sales of Android application and iOS application device will be number one in the world. So SoftBank has a strong lineup of device centering on iPhone and SoftBank Mobile has four goals, which \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that are enhance the device lineup and that was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that goal was achieved; and brand wise, the net addition number one should be recorded for many years; and the marketing rights, the advertisement likeability ranking is number one; and the content has been enriched, the GungHo and other group companies are producing a lot of attractive contents and that are selling well. So the four goals of enhancing device, marketing, advertisement and brands and content; of all four goals, three of them, device, sales and branding and content are doing pretty well. That said, there is a last hurdle to clear, which is network connectivity so that SoftBank users can connect anywhere. That's the most difficult hurdle to clear and also it takes time to clear. That's very important objective to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or hurdle to clear. Network satisfaction level is mainly constitute of speed and connectivity so those two are the main factors to bring the network satisfaction improvement. So first of all speed. We have made blocks of 5 kilometers times 5 kilometers in Japan map. And with these blocks, we had speed survey amongst the competitors and which one is the fastest. That survey has been conducted by the third-party called RBB TODAY. This is the company who produced the applications to measure the speed so this is not our survey, but sample numbers are 1.5 million and there was a result from using this sample of 1.5 million national samples, and with these 5 kilometers blocks SoftBank was number one amongst the competitors. In average speed wise, we were about twice as much of DoCoMo and because there is a product mix. So if we compare the same device which is iPhone, so we compare the iPhone to iPhone with our competitor KDDI au. And also we had a speed survey with the comparison of iPhones and we were about twice as much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 twice as fast as au's. This was also the result from the third-party speed survey, the company called RBD TODAY. And the sample numbers was about 1.5 million nationwide Other than that we had another survey companies in other third-parties such as kakaku.com, ICT Research and Development or the MMRI. There are several survey results and, basically, all the results showing that the SoftBank is the number one amongst the competitors. So this is not what we are saying, but this is what been delivered as a result from the third-parties. And they are showing that our speed or our results was the best amongst the competitors. So we had two targets in terms of network and also for speed. We have already win over the competitors which, I believe, we have achieved one of those targets. But at the same time, we have a challenge on the connectivity for the network satisfaction. And to resolve this connectivity issue, as we've been telling you that we've been showing the record high in operating income and we are crossing on to DoCoMo's results. In the previous earning \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right after the previous earnings results, I have reading those comments on Twitter. So good about the results or the performance, but at the same time you have to have better connectivity. So no excuse, but you have to have a better connectivity, such Twitter comments I have seen on the Twitter. And, of course, we've been putting every effort to build the base stations, but this was the last hope, which is the platinum band. So last year we have received the license for the platinum band and starting from July 24, we have been able to provide the platinum band available, and as mentioned, July 24 onwards that we have launched the platinum band. And we had a TV commercial as well on the platinum band. I believe that you remember, but just to share with you. [Video Presentation] (36:39 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 37:11) So as you saw those that are having a difficulty in connectivity, but with this platinum band, so we have admitted that, this TV commercial made us admit that we were not in good shape for the connectivity, but with this platinum band that we've been making a progress and improvement in the connectivity. So, I believe, that we had a very rush schedules in terms of base station construction, and as of March this year that we have submitted applications with the 16,000 base stations, but actually we have achieved that number two months earlier than the plan that we have submitted. So the end of January this year that we have already exceeded the numbers of base stations for platinum band with 16,000. And going forward the progress of the platinum band base stations construction has been making a good progress, so we recently \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I've been told on the Twitter that or the concerns that I'm not updating you the state as of platinum band, but I can tell you here today that we've been progressing and making a good progress in terms of platinum band base stations. And here with this expansion of the platinum band base stations, what happened to the call connection rate. This is something that I can report to you at the Interim Report. So voice call connection rate, we have users of different operators who agreed to participate in the survey and we made actual call, outgoing call to those 130,000 call through the each different operator's users including SoftBank, KDDI and DoCoMo and this made our actual outgoing call. So 130,000 call per month has been made and that will show us as a result whether that this call has been successfully connected or not and that result has been cumulated and this red line is the call, outgoing call to Android device by DoCoMo. And the next one, orange one, is the call outgoing to iPhone of au. And now what is SoftBank's, is that as of July 24, we have been \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have launched the platinum band and as of that timing, we were the last out of three, so starting from the bottom, and as of today what happened? Thresholds are here in this this slide. Finally, it may be just a on time. It's just an illusion, we don't know or the mistake of the survey, we don't know. But I can say that according to the survey result, out of 130,000 calls per month, we were able to have the best connection rate out of three. Actually, we started from the bottom and we actually exceeded or showing better rate than DoCoMo for about past five months and in the latest result against au that we were, actually, better in the connection ratio. So what you have in your mind, you may think that we are not number one and it's different from what you saw here so that your thinking maybe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 maybe 99% out of 100% people here thinks that the SoftBank is the worst and I was actually thinking that way too. Actually, about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the previous earnings results announcement we had a data which is showing that we are exceeding DoCoMo already, so in the three months before from now we had a data that we exceeds DoCoMo and I wanted to announce that, however, our officers, everybody was against that idea and at the management meeting, everybody is against that idea to announcing, but I was really motivated to make such announcement, but our office executive management say that it can be a misunderstanding, it can be a misstatement so that, actually, our executive officers were the most doubtful about that result. So that is why that I didn't make such announcement because we don't want to be regret on the announcement. It may be just a miscalculation, it can be just a one-time gain or only the illusion so that I didn't announce the result that which showing that we're exceeding DoCoMo in terms of call connection rate. It was prepared up until the previous day of the earnings results announcement, however, this time we've been already showing the results of five months consecutive months that are exceeding DoCoMo and also on our latest results, we already been higher than au as you can tell from this graph. It may be just a one time or temporary thing, happen to be just a coincident out of the 130,000 call, there could be some difference or bias, at least I can say that we are not the worst that's something that I can say for sure. But now that we are competing with competitors, we're sometimes better than competitors, so, I think, this affect from platinum band is even bigger than we expected and even brought us a better result than we expected. So that's the call connection rate, so this is nationwide survey. So like Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, those areas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some areas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 those areas that we're still losing in call connection rate, but those major three cities, Tokyo, Kansai, and Tokai compared with competitors those three major cities we are actually in number one position, as you can see in this graph, so it seems like in that way. So the populations of the Japan, about 60% of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are living in these three major cities. And speaking of such major cities, we are not the worst as a matter of fact. So according to the latest data, we maybe the number one. That's something that even better, far better than you expected, I believe. So even on Twitter I have received lots of complaints without any excuse. So last year that we were not able win to the championship game in SoftBank Hawks, but the previous year that we won so that you have a good hitter, but you don't have a good hit on the connection rate, so that kind of tweets around. And we have to make this rapid action otherwise there could be even more complaints, so we will regret such situation, but now we are not in far behind anymore. I think that we have already been very much close to or even better in terms of the connection ratio with the competitors. So that has been the voice calls that we've been talking about, but when it comes to the data connection ratio, how about that? So even that you have a voice call connectivity, and even that it's not showing the out of coverage, but sometimes when you cannot have a connections in data, so you're showing the antennas on your device, but data doesn't really downloadable, so that situation has been seen often. So that is not only the coverage or not, so even that you're in coverage, but the data is not really going through, so it doesn't time out. So that's becoming a very important issue, very important indicator. So the data connection rate is also another important key indicator, which also consist the customer satisfaction in terms of network. So that we wanted to also made a survey on the connection ratio in terms of data and Yahoo actually had a disaster warning application. Disaster warning application is something that gives you the warning in terms of earthquake or fire and if you are out of coverage so that you cannot receive that warning which \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's going to affect your life in the past in the Great East Japan Earthquake and the tsunami, those areas that's affected by tsunami, I believe, that the situation was not good and that was a big regret that we had. So disaster prediction or the people to flee from the disaster that is very important in our view. And disaster warning application check the connectivity of handsets every time, anytime, anywhere and that application whenever the user move around every 30 minutes the application sends a small packet to the data center. So users' phone sends signal or packet through that application to the data center, in that way the data connection rate can be measured and every day more than 100,000 data is collected and in every month more than 30 million data communication logs are collected every month. Even when customers are moving around that application send packet to the data logging system so that way the data connection rate can be measured. And here is the result of DoCoMo and KDDI. I didn't know that each company's data connection rate was better than others. Out of 30 million data points, data communication logs per month from the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and here is the results from the January 11 to January 29. And, actually, we keep track of data every day and data changed dynamically, and those two lines shows our competitors' data connection rate and SoftBank's result is this a gray line. Our data connection rate was better than our competitors. We are number one, maybe we were just lucky or maybe there was some error in the calculation or data processing, but, actually, this is the result of analyzing 30 million data points per month. So we can rely this. Maybe there are some deviation or some anomaly, but, again, this is the result of analyzing 30 million data communication logs every month and we keep track of results every day. And this is the result of all of the data connection all over Japan and we are number one. Maybe a lot of people is skeptical about this result. Maybe some people want to validate this data and if you want, yes please go ahead with validate this data. There are a lot of research body or media, there are a lot of resources to validate the results, I guess, so someone disprove or show us that this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the data we told is wrong then we will work on that. We will work to correct and improve our data connection rate. But according to this results, we are number one when it comes to data connection rate. Out of nine regions in Japan, Hokkaido, Tohoku, Hokuriku, Kanto, Tokai, Kansai, Chugoku, Shikoku and Kyushu, so please look at the results by region. Earlier I said that we are number one in Japan, nationwide, but here are the results by region. And those boxes highlighted in blue shows \\xe2\\x80\\x93 show SoftBank is number one. So out of nine regions, in six regions we were number one. We were not number one in Hokuriku, Kansai and Kyushu and we take it seriously because, I believe, that we should be number one in all nine regions. But so far in Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Tokai, Chugoku and Shikoku regions we are number one as a result of analyzing 30 million data communication logs every month. And we are taking data at every hour like the peak hours for commuting and also we can identify the name of streets where the customer sent the packet to the data analysis device. And with that data we can pinpoint where the connection was not good. So, again, we are not number in Hokuriku, Kansai and Kyushu regions and we take it really seriously, and we will work to improve the situation. But back in September 2010, I tweeted this. One day we will have a better network than DoCoMo back then a lot of people criticized our network quality, but I tweeted that one day we will have a better network than DoCoMo and my pride is at stake. And I always keep that in mind. I said in my tweet at Twitter account, in that Twitter that my highest priority is based on improving network to overtake DoCoMo's network quality with my pride at stake. So maybe the SoftBank is number one nationwide, in terms of data connection rate and voice connection rate we have overtaken DoCoMo already maybe just one time or one moment, but I believe that we have overtaken DoCoMo in terms of data connection rates and voice connection rates. Still we are not satisfied yet because like I said, we are not number one in all nine regions in Japan. We should prove that we are number one in all nine regions or maybe we are number one at point of time of our day. So once we become number one then we stay in number one for long time, so we will not stop making efforts on this. Our target number of platinum band base station as of March this year was 16,000, but we achieved that target two months ahead of the time. As of today, we have 16,000 platinum band base stations already, but like the smart-featured TV commercial said, we continue to increase the base stations and we will continue the platinum band service area. So we will \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are planning to increase the number of base stations to 36,000. So right now we have less than half the planned number and we have CapEx plan to increase the number of base stations, we also hunted locations for building base stations and we already secure the equipments, but still we are going to double the number of base stations. So, yes, at one point we became number one in terms of data connection rate and call connection rate, but until we solidify our number one position in data connection rate and voice connection rate, we will keep increasing the number of base stations, platinum band base stations. And we will use 1.7 gigahertz, which is the global band, for iPhone because iPhone use the global band, 1.7 gigahertz to use the LTE service. And with that we can increase the capacity and thus the customer can use data communication whenever they see a signal reception icon on their phone. So what we like \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are beginning to do is to bring the environment where the users can connect anywhere with SoftBank. We will not make any excuse if we fail to do that. We will just work towards realizing that the customer can connect anywhere with SoftBank. Every week, we have management meeting and we give a pep talk to network team and other service team to work harder, but today I'd like to give credit to our network team and other team to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because they have improved our network quality. And also I'd like to tell everyone hearing this presentation that we have improved the network connectivity and also whenever we promised, we always delivered the promise. For the outlook, for this fiscal year we are sure that our domestic consolidated operating income would exceed \\xc2\\xa5700 billion mark. I announced this target earlier this year, but we can achieve that target. Every time I announce the target, we always achieve the target or over achieved the target. And, again, about the \\xc2\\xa5700 billion operating income target, we do achieved this at the end of this fiscal year and for the next fiscal year, fiscal 2013 at that time we will adopt international financial reporting standards, but in countries under Japan GAAP we would \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are targeting to achieve the domestic consolidated operating income of \\xc2\\xa5800 billion in the fiscal year 2013, so that number is very close to the DoCoMo's operating income today. So in fiscal 2013 starting some April, we are targeting to generate \\xc2\\xa5800 billion consolidated operating income in Japan, and we always have the determination to be number one. So in Japan, we'd like to achieve that target. Now when we include the overseas business, and we hope to see the acquisition of Sprint will complete in fiscal 2013. And in 2014 we will adopt IFRS, but on the first year of acquisition, we should take account of M&A related accounting and also a lot of cost, one-time cost will be incurred. But even with that, we should observe all the negative impact and then still we are going to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are targeting to achieve \\xc2\\xa5700 billion of operating income under IFRS. And in fiscal 2014, we are targeting to renew the records of profit, our consolidated operating income including overseas business. So our next challenge is in the United States. Let me talk about Sprint, we expect to see synergies from the Sprint acquisition. Number one, smartphone; number two, network; and number three, our turnaround track record should be utilized. Now first of all smartphones, the Japan market is different than United States, so many people is skeptical about our synergy theory. But recently the smartphone used in Japan are pretty much same as what are used in United States. The smartphone are global standard smartphone that are used in Japan. So comparing Japan and U.S.in the number of purchase in smartphone, I believe that number will be twice as much as DoCoMo or even four times of KDDI. That will be the volume that we're looking at to purchase. So twice as much or four times as much of the smartphone purchase meaning that not because of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will give us the purchase power. The desirable chipset, desirable spectrum, desirable price, those are the one that we'd be able to negotiate, pre-installs of the content, so that negotiation power in terms of those factors can be enhanced and that will be the biggest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the biggest synergies that we'll be able to benefit. So that the purchase powers in smartphone in Japan, for example, DoCoMo was the biggest purchaser, that is why that they'll be able to put the functions such as one-sec or the others, and those demands were the requirements for the vendors. And that was the kind of the trend for the past 20-some years so far, but this will be the first time that the SoftBank will be able to exceed numbers of smartphone purchase compared to the those competitors. So U.S., in U.S. the Sprint purchase power is not equivalent to Verizon and the AT&T, but by combining the numbers the SoftBank and Sprint then we'll be able to become equivalent or even get closer to Verizon and AT&T, so that will also give the advantage to the Sprint as well. Next is the network equipment. The biggest company in terms of the network equipment is China Mobile, but the vendors of those installing the equipment in China Mobile is mainly the Chinese vendors. So excluding such factor, the major equipment vendors such as Ericsson, Nokia Siemens or Alcatel Lucent, so there are lots of companies and vendors like that, but equipment vendors with global standards, we will be able to have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we will become the biggest, one of the biggest purchaser in terms of network equipments and we will exceed AT&T or Vodafone or Verizon so that's why that's going to give us the advantage in terms of specification, functions, requirements and also the price so that we'll be able to take an advantage in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 over those companies as well. That's another one of the biggest synergies. And third, not least \\xe2\\x80\\x93 last, but not least something that we'd able to share with Sprint is the proven track record or the proven turnaround track record. WILLCOM, Japan Telecom, Vodafone even Yahoo Japan as well, we've been expanding their profitability continuously and their knowhow is one of the biggest invisible asset that we have which is something that we'd able to share with Sprint. And now that we're showing the biggest profitability and that's something that we'd able to share the value with Sprint. So that we believe we will be able to bring the EBITDA margin of 16% towards 30% in some time later. So we have started the information exchange meeting every week. It's not yet the one group company yet. So there is no any commanding or any orders, there is rules of origami jumping. So there is no any orders or command, but what we're doing is we're learning each other and that we're sharing, learning the information that we have. So here shows our meetings, so we have face to face meeting as well, and we have such meetings every week Tuesday morning in Japan time or the evening of Monday U.S. time, and this is regular basis. The day before yesterday that I just returned from U.S. and we are planning to have a face-to-face meeting in every month basis and also their management is visiting us, so at least once in two weeks that we have a chance to have the face-to-face meeting or in using the TV conference that we're using and that's going to give us a chance to have information exchange in every week. We've said that they have even more confidence that we'd be able to compete their competitors. So here is the summary, domestic operating income, \\xc2\\xa5800 billion and also provide the better connectivity, connect anywhere. As explained earlier in terms of connectivity, we are or maybe the number one position in terms of connectivity. We do need to spend some more days and months. We maybe not always the number one, but here that we are even determined to increase the number of base stations for platinum band so that we would be able to have a solid number one position in terms of connectivity. In addition to that, that we would like to drive growth with overseas opportunity and we'd like to make the big success together with our partners. That is all for my presentation. Thank you very much and thank you for your continuous support.\",\n",
       " '2012 Q4': \"I am Son from SoftBank. Thank you very much for coming today. So I have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I wear the green-colored tie, which is a spring color. So spring has come. About seven years ago, SoftBank broadband, Yahoo! BB has just launched and was recording about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion annual basis of the negative figure. And those are the kind of dark time that we spent. And now, looking back that situation, I believe that nobody could imagine what we have done so far since then. After this session \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in this session that I'm going to go into the details of the business overview of SoftBank in Japanese market, including operating income, and this is the first time we are going to report the exceeding of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of operating income in domestic market. \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income, looking at the history of the Japanese industry history, as far as I know, Toyota and NTT Group consolidated base, so those two are the kind of companies that I remember that exceeding \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of operating income. Therefore, I believe we will be the third company to exceed \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of operating income in the history. So that's the kind of the scale that we're talking about for our company and that's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it represents \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my tie is representing the feeling of me, which is spring. And in English it says, spring has come. And near future, we will say Sprint has come. So that's the kind of time that we will be able to say in official basis sometime soon. Now, let me go into the details of the overview of the business. Today we have two sessions. First session, we were explaining \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I will be explaining the overview of the business for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. And starting around 5:00, the second session, we're going to talk about and provide you the updates on the status of Sprint transaction and we will share with you what is the current status of the Sprint transaction, so that's how we're going to proceed today's meeting. Now going to the first session. Seven years ago as I mentioned earlier, we have acquired Vodafone K.K. Back then SoftBank was about to hit the bottom. We're spending about four years of the negative figures, and since then that we have a little bit improved. So right after then we have decided the acquisition of Vodafone K.K. That time SoftBank itself was not yet robust in terms of finance or the operations of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or the management. So we were about to kind of stand up and walk. However, the Vodafone K.K. back then was also \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and was still questionable regarding the robustness of the management, so they were suffering and then we were about to start getting out from the sufferings. And about 4% of the shares back then are base stations' numbers, about 18,000 CM preference. It was a number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ranked under number 31 in the operating income of \\xc2\\xa576.3 billion, and the operating income was actually declining sharply at that moment. On the other hand, DOCOMO on your right-hand side, they were overwhelming number one and 48% in terms of net addition shares, number of base station CM preference, in any aspects DOCOMO was winning over Vodafone and Vodafone was losing over those elements. So Vodafone was declining sharply at that moment and we have decided to acquire this company. And starting from then, I had a longstanding ambition till today that we've been having this ambition, which is to exceed DOCOMO within 10 years. Internally, I expressed my feelings and ambition and also with the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our sales agents and partners. I also communicated with them that we aim for exceeding DOCOMO within 10 years. So I had strong feelings and solutions about that. So we had such feelings and ambition, however, didn't have concrete idea how we do that. But then, we were also told that SoftBank is going to become the losing ground. It's going to lose the ground and taken share by the competitors. So that was kind of a stretched ambition that I made back then. However, as I mentioned earlier, SoftBank's operating income in domestic market, we are quite sure to be able to exceed \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, which means we are about to exceed DOCOMO's profit as well. So now let me go into the detail. Our consolidated base net sales, 6% increase, \\xc2\\xa53.4 trillion. EBITDA, this was \\xc2\\xa51.1 trillion with 13% increase. EBITDA here, we had increased by 13% and when it comes to EBITDA margin, we were hitting number one in both Japan and U.S., including those other telecom operators, so 50% of EBITDA margin here. EBITDA margin with 50%. I believe this figure is very rare even compared with the other industries and here in Japan and U.S. like Verizon in U.S. or DOCOMO in Japan that we were able to exceed those companies' EBITDA margins. Operating income record high for eight consecutive years and 10% increase with \\xc2\\xa5745 billion. This is also closing in on DOCOMO's operating income. So closing in on DOCOMO and actually DOCOMO was losing or the negative 4% of operating income in terms of gross ratio. On the contrary, we were 10% increase so comparing with those that there were a 14% gap in between their results and ours. And because of the net debt decrease, therefore, that with this interest burden that we were able to have a bigger ordinary income with the 14% increase. As for the net income, last fiscal year we had one-time gain, which has also announced in the previous occasion. Last fiscal year, we had the impact from sales of Yahoo! Inc. shares in U.S. and also impact from IPO of Renren Inc. and others. So along with those impact, we had a one-time gain in the last fiscal year. But excluding those one-time gain, and if we only see the pure net income basis, it's a record high. But including those that it could seem \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it could be regarded as declines. However, if we only see the net income, excluding the one-time gain and I believe we are making a stable trend here as well. And the summary of the consolidated earnings results shown on this slide and the operating cash flow also showing a steady growth, and nearly close to \\xc2\\xa5900 billion. Cash flow details also shown in this page. As a result, net interest bearing debt has been \\xe2\\x80\\x93 keep reducing, and we had acquisition of Sprint convertible bonds, along with the transaction with Sprint, and which is indicated in blue bar. And even we increased that, that will give us a \\xc2\\xa50.73 trillion of net interest-bearing debt. So because we have a increase in EBITDA, so that taking the net debt over EBITDA multiple, we are maintaining very much appropriate level here. And even including these obligations, it would give us about 1.3 times so that compared with the global telecom operator, I believe we are a very well balanced company. Dividend per share, no change in dividend policy. And now going through the more details about the communication business in Japan. As mentioned earlier, at the time of Vodafone K.K., there was about 0.17 million per year for net additions, but now that we are taking about more than 0.1 million in one month, so that we actually get \\xe2\\x80\\x93 gaining net additions of one year portion of Vodafone K.K. in one month, so that in average basis, we are close to 300,000 net addition per month. And in the past three years, in the latest three years, we have exceeded 10 million net additions in three years. In the net additions, of course that we are number one in three companies with competitors but starting from this fiscal year that we're having WILLCOM which is going to, which has plans to be consolidated and also in mobile which is already announced as a subsidiary. So those customer base is going to be regarded as a group customer base and that will even makes us bigger in terms of net additions. And if we compare with the Verizon or AT&T in the U.S., we will exceed AT&T and also closing in on Verizon. And of course, competitors are running multiple brands under the name such as prepaid and others and they have wholesale as well and that's included in their numbers. But what we can say is that where our scale of the cost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 net additions is very much comparable to the AT&T and Verizon. And as of today, there are many coverage saying that we are number three in domestic market. So SoftBank is usually called as the number three player in the market. But as a matter of fact, our revenue profit is going to exceed DOCOMO. And also in terms of customer base, we are clearly exceeding KDDI. But even before the Sprint numbers that we are already exceeding KDDI number with the 41.88 billion subscriber base as the SoftBank Group. This 41.88 million has not yet close to DOCOMO subscriber base. However, as I mentioned Sprint has come, in such situation we will be very much close to Verizon's customer base. I mentioned that net addition-wise, we are very much comparable to the Verizon's customer net additions and even in a total customer base that we will be very much comparable to the Verizon's customer base. In ARPU, after the acquisition of Vodafone K.K., we spent about two years to make that turnaround but since then we'll be making a steady trend in ARPU. The customer base increased quite rapidly and also having a steady trend in ARPU, therefore that will give us best revenue growth. So when it comes to mobile telecom service revenue, we have a steady growth of 9% increase. So this 9% compare with the global operators how that positions. You can see here that we are the number one growth rate in Japan and U.S. So in comparison with the U.S. and Japan, then that the SoftBank is showing number one growth rate in terms of mobile service revenue. As a result, that the mobile EBITDA margin, as I mentioned earlier, we are hitting 50% improved dramatically. When the mobile business was under the umbrella of Vodafone K.K., the mobile EBITDA margin kept falling, but once the mobile business came under our umbrella, the EBITDA margin started to grow and improved dramatically. And if we compare the numbers with the China Mobile and others, the mobile EBITDA margin growth rate is by far the largest in the global market. Not only that, but also when it comes to mobile operating income, we recorded \\xc2\\xa5467.8 billion, six times or even seven times growth from \\xc2\\xa576.3 billion back in 2006. And mobile EBITDA, we recorded 14% year-on-year increase and which is the record high for the sixth consecutive years and compare that with other global players, well, our EBITDA margin is 50%, which is number one in the global market; and our mobile EBITDA growth rate, which was 14%, that is global number one. So we are recording the highest EBITDA margin in the world. DOCOMO's mobile EBITDA growth rate was negative 1%, but ours was 14% positive, and by far the highest and that number includes the WILLCOM number. After WILLCOM came under our umbrella, two months later the WILLCOM started to record net additions, and since then the WILLCOM subscriber number has been renewing record every month. And the company is generating profit steadily. So we help WILLCOM to terminate the WILLCOM's reorganization process and rehabilitation proceedings. From the second quarter of this fiscal year, we will consolidate WILLCOM after the company finished rehabilitation proceedings. And another important objective of our company is to achieve number one in connectivity. So far SoftBank has a bad reputation, which is around the heavy debt and poor connectivity. But as old saying says that the people should look at the latest news instead of being obsessed with history, bad history. And SoftBank launched the platinum band service from July last year, and since then the Sprint \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, SoftBank has increased the number of platinum band capable base stations. And within a year, we have built 22,000 base stations capable of platinum band services, which is by far the fastest speed of base station construction. On rainy days or even on the days when the Japan was hit by typhoon, we didn't stop building base stations. As a result, the smartphone users, SoftBank smartphone users, au smartphone users and DOCOMO smartphone users alike if \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it turns out that the call connectivity rate of SoftBank's smartphone is number one. We run a survey using the disaster warning application, which helped us to collect connectivity data. That application allows smartphone users to connect the nearest base station. Using that application, more than 300 million calls were made to the smartphone users of three carriers to check the data connectivity and for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 also the call connectivity was checked using such applications. So the results are shown on this page, but those results are not from just testing the connectivity in 200 places or 300 places. This is the result \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these results are from the scientific research and analysis. The survey and research showed that the SoftBank's connectivity both in call and data is number one. Now when it comes to iPhone 5 connectivity, both in call and data communication, the data showed that the SoftBank's iPhone connectivity is better than other companies' iPhone. In the past, people complained about SoftBank's connectivity and that was the reasons why some people chose our competitors for iPhone. But today, the increasing number of people started to subscribe to SoftBank's iPhone 5 because of better connectivity over the competitors. Now data connection rate. For the past month, SoftBank's data connection rate has been number one constantly among all the smartphones across all the carriers. And when it comes to iPhone 5 data connection rate, the SoftBank iPhones, it's by far better because of their constant connectivity. And this result took account of the so-called packet congestion. Packet congestion mean that the data stopped flowing for longer than 10 seconds. And such packet congestions were taken into account in the results. So the SoftBank's iPhone provides better and constant connectivity to the users compared to the competitors' iPhone 5. Now when it comes to data connectivity, in Gulf Coast, the SoftBank's connectivity is a bit behind of the competitors, but that is due to the research on smartphones. But when it comes to iPhone 5 survey, the SoftBank's iPhone's connectivity at the Gulf Coast is better than competitors' and in leisure facilities, the SoftBank's connectivity is number one across all the smartphones and among iPhones, and that's true to fast foods, eateries and shopping malls, or the heavy congested stations and universities as well and electronic retail stores and convenient stores. All the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more than 30,000 convenient stores were surveyed in terms of data connectivities and SoftBank smart was number one across all the smartphones and iPhone 5. And at the hotel and expressway rest area, the same was true. And please look at these purple dots show the 3G or LTE available areas and in this area more than 30 million calls were made to check the connectivity and blue area is connected \\xe2\\x80\\x93 show the connectivity for LTE, but not 3G, but in SoftBank as \\xe2\\x80\\x93 among the SoftBank iPhone users all these purple dotted areas were \\xe2\\x80\\x93 provide coverages. In case of the competitors' coverage, the users can enjoy the connectivity in the blue dotted area, but in red area the speed slowed down. And in terms of SoftBank iPhone users they can enjoy the better connectivity, especially among the LTE service areas. So because of that the packet congestion less happened or happens less often than the competitors and that you can see the LTE coverage area is bigger than the competitors' LTE coverage area in Tokai area and Kanto area as well and same goes for Kansai. Actually, we put the wrong picture on page 52, heading is wrong. The SoftBank picture is on the right-hand side. Yes, sorry, we put the wrong picture. Let me check, but I bet that these pictures were wrongly placed and I bet my [growth in ties] today. Anyway, this page showed wrong headings. The SoftBank coverage area has bigger, larger LTE coverage area than competitors and Weekly ASCII magazine also run LTE speed survey. And that you can see in major cities: Fukuoka, Kansai and Sapporo, Nagoya, and Tokyo area, we are number one. And we launched the double LTE service. Using the EMOBILE spectrums, we can provide double LTE service. In Ikebukuro area, for example, the double LTE provides better connectivity as you can see on this page. And in this class, the green line showed the connectivity before double LTE launch and blue line showed after double LTE launch. As you can see that the data connectivity improved and fewer packet congestion took place. So it was like we have two lines of expressway rather than just one line of expressway. And another third-party researcher that planned a survey. And according to that survey, our connectivity in customer smartphone experience was number one, and speed improvement-wise the SoftBank was ranked number one. And that was supported by our aggressive CapEx spending. We acquired platinum bands and we launched double LTE. And to make platinum bands and LTE service available, we heavily spend the CapEx. That's what we had done so far. And in 2013, we will also take a good care of network facilities. So as I said, we were determined to exceed DOCOMO within 10 years. That was our longstanding ambition, but we forecast that we could hit \\xc2\\xa51 trillion mark with our domestic operating income, which is comparable to the NTT Group's consolidated operating income. So we will become the third Japanese company to hit \\xc2\\xa51 trillion mark in terms of operating income, after Toyota and NTT Group. And NTT DOCOMO announced that their operating income forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2014 will be \\xc2\\xa5840 billion under U.S. GAAP, but our operating income would exceed \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. That's what we are determined to do. So whenever I make any comments about forecast, I'm very careful about that and you know that and if I cannot make any forecast, I am not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 make any statement about that. And whenever that I say about any forecast, I make sure to deliver that and I believe that we have seen such situations and that's the kind of the actions that you've been seeing. And here that what I'm saying that I'm going to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are going to exceed \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in terms of operating income, which means that I am very much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have a strong confidence in myself and ourselves to do so. And as a result as I mentioned earlier, seven years ago in every aspect, we were losing in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 against DOCOMO, but now that we are exceeding largely compared to DOCOMO in those aspects. However, number one in Japan it's just a stepping stone from our understanding. We've been looking at mobile Internet and we were not the global number one in mobile Internet, so that with the information revolution that we want to make people happy. So that is our philosophy and to realize that philosophy we want to become and need to aim for global number one in mobile Internet. Up to here is my presentation for the first session and here that I would like to open the floor for the questions regarding the business results. \",\n",
       " '2013 Q1': \"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am Son. I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the style that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my thinking style in usual days, the period is not to this months or this year or the target is not only for the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this months or this year. So anything that I think, probably 10% or 20% are thinking about this near future like this months or this year, but the 80% to 90% of my thinking is looking at 10 years later, 20 years later or 30 years later. So most of the time that I always thinking about such future, that's why that I [indiscernible] (02:47) that I make comment sounds like \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from the general public, it sounds like a dream. It's not realistic. People may think that I am not thinking properly, but this style of my thinking is the same since my foundation of SoftBank. And usually, it is usually being called as a dreamer or a big dream. The other day, we held a general \\xe2\\x80\\x93 annual general meeting of shareholders, which was held in last month. And that time that I also made our presentation regarding my big dream, which was to become the global number one company and build the company growing for the next 300 years. So company growing for the next 300 years, that's why that we have been working so hard to be able to build the company growing for the next 300 years, which is a long, long way to go, and I believe that it's a long journey for all of us. But if we don't think that way, then we'll never be able to reach there. That's one of my thinking. So having \\xe2\\x80\\x93 building a company, growing for the next 300 years, so the first chapter of building a company growing for the next 30 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 300 years is to aim at toward number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 becoming number one in Japan. So number one in Japan has been our target and aim for the chapter one of our journey, which was to exceed DOCOMO in terms of EBIT or numbers of users or connectivity. So in any regards that we wanted to exceed DOCOMO within 10 years; that is a comment that I made at the time of acquisition of Vodafone K.K., which happened about six years ago from now. In the chapter one, we believe that we will be able to achieve this year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this fiscal year, and we have a clear view that we will be achieving this chapter one. So that's why that we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I will say we are entering into chapter two, which to become a global number one, in that we would like to make a one step forward towards a global number one. So at the dawn of the chapter two, this month, 11 of July, we have completed the transaction of acquisition of Sprint and also our acquisition of Clearwire and making it as 100% subsidiary of Sprint. So these two events were the one step forward towards the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the chapter two, and entering into U.S. market. And I know that our competitors there is the big and competitive companies with the overwhelming number of subscriber base and overwhelming profitabilities and also having a great network. And to challenge those great companies is not exactly the same as the competition that we've been facing against DOCOMO in Japanese market. So it's like a Japan league towards world league. So that's something that we would like to make a challenge towards. And for that, I would like to recap the consolidated earnings results and first quarter of 2013 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 fiscal year 2013 highlights here. A record high EBIT or operating income for eight consecutive periods. So having a consecutive period record high is not easy things to do. As you know, we've been having \\xe2\\x80\\x93 being a solo operator of selling iPhone, and that was one momentum that we've been able to have. But at the same time, our competitor KDDI started launching iPhone as well. In that moment that there was speculations that the people of iPhone username moved to KDDI instead of SoftBank, so that we may lose a lot of customer base. The same type of speculation was made at the time of Vodafone K.K. acquisition, but with those events happened here and there, but still without any excuse that we've been able to make a record high EBIT eight \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for eight consecutive periods. And also net income grew by 2.3 times. And let me go into the details. Net sales, record high, and a 21% increase, \\xc2\\xa5881.1 billion in EBITDA, again, record high. This is the 23% increase. And operating income here was increased by 92%, of which about \\xc2\\xa5150 billion came from one-time gain from making GungHo a subsidiary. So this is the one-time gain included here. So this is not happens every year base. So we don't say that the 92% increase every year base. However, the contributions of the operating income coming from GungHo will continue going forward based on their core business. So even excluding this one-time gain, but as you can see the darker bars here, this is the part without this one-time gain, and still you can see that we're making a steady growth in operating income. So with those, we have been able to completely outpaced and exceed DOCOMO. So DOCOMO has seen [ph] a gain (10:01) of Japan market, and we have a 92% increase in operating income. And the 2.3 times in net income. And this again is a record high net income. As you can tell from this chart, just a few years ago, up until 2006, we were in red. And since the launch of Yahoo! BB, the broadband business, we've been suffering from the red figures here. But after then, we turned around and we've been accumulating the profitabilities year-by-year. So here shows the summary of consolidated earnings results. Net sales, EBITDA, EBIT, net income in any index, we have been able to exceed the year-on-year base with the record high figures here. Cash flow, as you can see on this chart. And with the partnership with Sprint, we have increased the debt. Net interest-bearing debt divided by EBITDA multiple here. At the time of Vodafone K.K. acquisition, we had a peak level of 6.2 times, and which came down to 1.8 times under IFRS base. And after the completion of Sprint acquisition, it will go up to 3.3 times. And we have already experienced such increase in debt, but the competitive time of Vodafone K.K., quite a big size of debt, but it's quite a healthy level. And when you compare with the other companies, these are the large companies in Japan with more than \\xc2\\xa52 trillion market cap. And out of 19 companies, we are locked in here. So the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 amongst the market cap more than \\xc2\\xa52 trillion companies, we are in the middle of those members. But we believe this is only one-time increase after the completion of Sprint acquisition. And as you know, right before the completion of Sprint acquisition, we had already improved down to 1.8 times. Many people imagine SoftBank as a big debt company and having a lot of debt. So we've been called as a big debt company. But as a matter of fact, we've been improving balance sheet drastically, and you can tell from this chart. As a result, we have increased our capability of financing. And as a result, it made us enabled to go into the overseas market. Dividend, we will continue at the same rate. And now, let me go into the domestic communications business, one of our primary. So a record high for four consecutive periods in net additions, 810,000 net additions this quarter. Comparing with the competitors, 950,000 of ours and competitors as well are, 90,000 and 670,000 respectively on top, which includes the EMOBILE and WILLCOM. So if we exclude those two, it gives us 810,000. So even though we have a different brand, but substantially, those two are the SoftBank Group companies. So with those additions, that will give us 950,000 net additions. Internally, whenever that we have our management meeting, SoftBank Telecom, which originally was JAPAN TELECOM and also EMOBILE and WILLCOM, so those companies are always discussed at the same time in our management meeting. So we all see how well can we improve the performance of those subsidiaries. That's what we discussed. So from that sense, that we will say 950,000 net additions are a substantial base of net additions. So as a result of our customer base, 32.83 million that it was the steady growth, so also depending on which brand we will refer to. But as a company's customer base, we will say 42.83 million. So this is numbers for our customer base. And we have acquired Sprint. So by adding Sprint subscribers, the total number of subscribers in SoftBank Group exceeds that of DOCOMO. So we outpaced DOCOMO completely in terms of subscriber. Number of subscribers increased not only that, but also ARPU also increased. We have seen a steady increase trend of ARPU. And at the same time, we see the steady increasing trend of subscriber. And that's why the telecom service revenue, especially mobile service revenue, has been increasing steadily. Actually this quarter, we marked 28% increase year-over-year, which is respectable. Comparing with other mobile operators around the world, our mobile service revenue growth rate is by far larger, 28%, which is global number one. Our mobile service revenue growth rate was by far higher than that of China Mobile, AT&T and Verizon. Revenue has been increasing, and also mobile EBITDA margin is the highest in the world. Our mobile EBITDA margin is 53%, and that is a significant improvement compared to the number at the time of Vodafone K.K., so the sharp decrease of EBITDA margin. And when we recorded the better EBITDA margin, some people said that the SoftBank is dressing up the book, our revenue, but actually we didn't do that. Maybe the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we can \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are constantly increasing the EBITDA margin. If we dress up our book, we will not able to pay tax every year, and we cannot \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we will not able to increase the amount of tax we pay to the government. And let's look at the mobile EBITDA margin comparing with our global competitors. And as you can see on this page, our EBITDA margin is number one, 53%. And here is mobile EBIT or mobile operating income in the SoftBank Group, which increased 24% year-on-year. And that's a great contributor to the SoftBank's consolidated operating income. And let's look at WILLCOM's result. WILLCOM went bankrupt and the company had hard time finding a sponsor for rehabilitation. But SoftBank became a sponsor of the WILLCOM, which was under rehabilitation. But once WILLCOM came under the SoftBank's umbrella, the company saw the turnaround of its results and performance and number of subscriber made a quite a turnaround. And from July this year, the WILLCOM became the consolidated subsidiary of SoftBank. And upon the WILLCOM becoming the consolidated subsidiary, we re-measure the company's share at fair value. At the time of when we became the sponsor of the WILLCOM, the company's value was \\xc2\\xa5300 million. But as of today, after re-measured at fair value, the company is now \\xc2\\xa5104.1 billion, because since we became the sponsor of the WILLCOM, the company had seen the increase of subscriber and increase of revenue. The company achieved both the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the turnaround in both subscriber and EBIT. When we acquired Vodafone K.K., we were determined to outpace DOCOMO in the future. Back then, actually we determined to do that, but actually we didn't have any ground. We don't know if we were able to do that, because when we acquired Vodafone K.K., Vodafone's profitability was falling. And also, at that time, we had no experience in mobile operator \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mobile business -communications business. So when we talked about our future goal of outpacing DOCOMO, many people doubted if we could achieve that, because we had no experience. And also at that time, the Vodafone K.K. had seen the declining profit and number of subscribers. Actually at that time, we were not so sure, but still we had passion to achieve that goal. And also we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at that time, we were determined to outpace DOCOMO in many aspects, not only subscriber, but also the profitability and services as well. So back then, we reviewed what we have to do. And \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but at that time, we set the targets of outpacing DOCOMO in terms of operating income and also number of subscribers on a consolidated basis. Also, at that time, we were becoming to outpace DOCOMO in terms of connectivity. So operating income subscribers and connectivity, in three areas, we worked hard to outpace DOCOMO, and we achieved those targets. And connectivity improvement was the toughest things to do. And until recently \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and actually, we are still fighting with our competitors. Until recently, we didn't have a license to use the platinum band. And because of that, we are at a disadvantage. And we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because of that, we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we fought an uphill battle because of lack of platinum band. But July 2012, we started platinum band service, because we were granted the license. For a long time, the DOCOMO and KDDI had 15 megahertz-by-15 megahertz, but we acquired platinum band license 15x15 only in July 2012. So we were years behind our rivals. But once we were granted access \\xe2\\x80\\x93 well, actually that license we received is like a condition of 15 megahertz-by-15 megahertz. On the 15 megahertz \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5 megahertz-by-5 megahertz were readily available, but remaining 10 megahertz-by-10 megahertz were not readily available as of July, because there are a lot of users \\xe2\\x80\\x93 existing users of 10 megahertz-by-10 megahertz like the taxi dispatcher or a cab dispatcher service or other businesses. So we had to convince existing users of 10 megahertz-by-10 megahertz to stop using all these existing radio. And on the existing users agreed to stop using that, we could use that platinum band. So readily available band was just 5 megahertz-by-5 megahertz, but that was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that made a difference, a big difference in our business. So of course, we will continue to convince existing 10 megahertz-by-10 megahertz users to stop using them so that free access spectrum for our services. And to make that happen, we will offer some alternate solution [indiscernible] (24:57) to existing users. We are still working on that. But anyway, only 5 megahertz-by-5 megahertz for platinum band were readily available, and we are using that. And to make most of that 5 megahertz-by-5 megahertz, we were building the platinum band capable \\xe2\\x80\\x93 platinum band at the breakneck speed. And because of that, we have so many platinum band compatible base stations. And so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we start \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we try to fill the white space of connectivity. And to make that happen, we are collecting the data connection rate. And actually we developed that technology, which \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for which we are filing patent application. And with that technology, we are utilizing the big data of application communication. And so we can \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with that technology, we can collect the building data or the base station data, time data, shop data and else. And with that, we can analyze 30 billion data records. And with that analysis, we can pinpoint where is the white spot or blank space of connectivity. And that technology is for applications, smartphone application for both iOS device and Android device. That was originally leased by Yahoo! Japan for disaster warning and also the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 theirs is so called [ph] WiFi Checker or Lamen Checker (26:37) applications that are installed in Android and iOS devices. And with that application, we can collect log of data connectivity of not only SoftBank users, but also DOCOMO and KDDI users. And with that application, we can tell the data of which model of smartphone at \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and also, we can pinpoint the time when the application was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, data connectivity was established. And so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and also, we can locate where the user was at the time of data collection. So we can collect data by model of smartphone, by the minutes, by hour and by area. When our competitors had communication failure, we learned prior to our competitors that there were \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there must be the communication failure, because we were analyzing 30 billion data records. And I'd like to show the sample. This is Tokyo area at 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Actually it's a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so the triangle, blue triangle shows flow of people and red dots is where people are staying. So we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by monitoring these dots and triangles, we can see where the data connectivity was established and where the blank space was there. And also, we can tell such \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we can keep track of such \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the flow of people by model of handsets or by hour. We have 100 meter-by-100 meter grid. And so we can conduct analysis by the grid. And we are the first in the world to do such detailed analysis. And because of using that data, we filled the blank spots. And as a result, we are improving both voice and data connectivity. Until recently, a lot of media reported that the SoftBank message of better connectivity is just a false report and based on the third-party analysis. But actually, such third-party analysis is just the result of serving at 200 spots. But actually, we are serving the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such connectivity all around Japan and 100 meter-by-100 meter grid. Using the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our proprietary technology, we are conducting such survey and analysis of data log, because we wanted to outpace DOCOMO in terms of connectivity. So this is the result of call connection rate of LTE smartphone in comparison with our competitors. This is only about LTE smartphones. Of course, when it comes to the call connection rate of our older handsets, we are almost comparable or maybe we lose to our competitors depending on models. So our platinum band was not available. For the handset without the capability of platinum band, then they'll never be able to enjoy the effect of the platinum band. So that is why that haven't had a remarkable improvement. But at least from five type of handsets or Android DOCOMO au's handsets available in the market, if we compare with those same type of the handset, then we have already increased and improved and better in terms of call connection rate. And when it comes to the data connection rate, we have even better results compared to the competitors. So it's not the misunderstanding. This is not the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just the image. This is not a one-time illusion. It is a scientific data. It explains that we have already exceeded overwhelmingly against the competitors. If there is anybody who has an objection, please show us this scientific data with 30 billion data to make any objection. If you just find one place, two place and don't see the connectivity, it doesn't really make sense, but in the tunnels, undergrounds, residential areas, mountain areas, inside of buildings, so in total of those areas, in Japanese areas. As you saw those red dot \\xe2\\x80\\x93 dotted lines and all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 dotted and also the blue triangles, so those are the actual users using and also the moving area or the staying area, we are grasping those data's of connections rate as a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in a scientific way. So in the third parties' pay, we start seeing such result as well. This is the press release by MMD LABO. So this is to show the packet congestion instances. So this was tested 200 times at each station of Yamanote Line in Tokyo and out of 200, you see the antenna bars on the display, so it's a three antenna bars, so five bars available on the display. But as a matter of fact, when you try to access the website or accessing to Yahoo! or accessing to Google, then that you never be able to get the data available which means that your device has a packet congestion, so packet is not comes out. So in Shinagawa Station, for au case, there are only June 21 released information by MMD Labo, 105 times out of 200, 80 times in Shinjuku and against that, our case, we have much better results here, 18 times congested in Shinagawa and I say this is not acceptable so I made a big fuss about it internally. But still, if you compare with competitors, still, we're showing the much better results out of 200 times, two times, or four times, sometimes to 18 times congestion, but 18 times still, we should make that down to zero. But because the data growing exclusively and the smartphone is growing explosively and we are using the limited resources still has to make a smooth packet traffic which is a very much effort. This is only the comparison we see here. But if you compare with DOCOMO, once again, they tested in 200 times up to each station and also in orders of larger number of times in packet congested instances of JR stations and there are some numbers that the DOCOMO experience the packet congestion, but our case was all zero. So what we have seen that we have three targets in terms of achieving or exceeding DOCOMO operating income, customer base and connectivity. So here it shows that we have already exceeded DOCOMO in terms of connectivity. And this is the another third-party result survey by Kaden Hihyo and this is the iPhone 5 LTE 75 Mega-bps area survey. And our available points was six times of au out of 54 points in Tokyo Metropolitan area. And another third-party survey, other than I just explained, so like a speed test, ICT Research & Consulting, MMRI, RBB TODAY and those third-party companies making a speed test and for that, we have outpacing the competitors. So there are several way of survey and a difference in individual experience, but from the scientific analysis and the scientific data that we can \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have a confident to say that we a have much better in terms of the connectivity including the third-party results. And also here shows the serious incidents; material incidents that must be reported to MIC. And this is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 material incidents means that affecting over 30,000 users for two consecutive hours and in this case you are required to report to the Ministry of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 MIC. So there are such regulations and if you violate, of course, you're going to be penalized. And under such rule, how many of the report has been made or how many trouble, serious incidents has occurred in competitors. You can see that there are lots of press conference regarding the apology on the serious incidents, but which happened in previous years. But now after then that the au is having \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and facing such serious incidents, however, we have no incident at all for 796 days, so serious incidents meaning that which requires the report to minister of MIC. This is the longest record from my understanding and we've been able to realize this. So SoftBank after the Vodafone K.K. acquisition, I believe this 796 days are the long \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is the longest record. And we have to keep making efforts to make sure that we don't have any network down. But to make that happen, of course, we have to spend some CapEx, and we've been making accelerated CapEx here. And since that we have approval on allocations of the spectrum of platinum band, we have to make a maximum use of it. And also that we don't have to make any packet congestion, which means that we do need to have a big investment here, and that that made us still make accelerated CapEx. And this will be peaking out this fiscal year so that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are not, of course, not satisfied yet. And we are building a lot of antennas in the mountain areas, remote areas. But I believe that we'll be able to finish this around in this fiscal year. And we are peaking out the amount of CapEx going forward. So size of the CapEx, I believe, that it's about double the size of KDDIs as far as I know. So we have double the size of the CapEx and KDDI, and we're making every effort to make the improvements happen. So up to here is our mobile or the domestic business. One \\xe2\\x80\\x93 another business which we also see as a core business is the Internet business. Originally, SoftBank started our business as a Internet company, not as a communications or telecommunications company. Although that we have a core business on mobile, and since that the trend is focusing on the mobile phones, mobile business, and we have to have infrastructures for that, so that's the difference from the competitors. We are not base on the telecom company, and we are on Internet base, so that we need to expand our mobile Internet, and to do so, that we have started our infrastructure business. So this Internet business, which is a core of the core business, we have hit 1,300 mark in terms of number of SoftBank Group companies. There are so many companies joining into the SoftBank Group. And that they are making their own \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they have their own CEO. They have their own CTO, CFO, and independently running their own business. And we have a totally different brand. So not many people can recognize that these company are in the SoftBank Group. But actually these other companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most of the cases, we are the major shareholders of those companies, and also we see this company as our group company. And of which the main row \\xe2\\x80\\x93 main group company is Yahoo! Japan Corporation. Last year that they have refreshed their management, we have worried because our founders had a great efforts, great achievements. And although that the Yahoo! Inc. in U.S. were suffering from their results and also having difficulty in income, but Yahoo! Japan has keep its increase in the revenue. And if we change or refresh the management, there were some concerns it may slow down the performance. But mainly those young management led by Mr. Miyasaka, CEO, and their growth has been reaccelerated. One \\xe2\\x80\\x93 another totally not expected, as a matter of fact, but this company have changed drastically, all of the sudden last year. Compared to the second quarter, this quarter was increased by 11 times in terms of net sales. And operating income, also 34 times. So it's making a drastic growth here. This company is chaired by my younger brother, and SoftBank is now having this company as a consolidated subsidiary this year. Puzzle & Dragons, which is the game of GungHo, is making a steady growth and now exceeding 70 million customer base or the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, number of downloads. In comparison with the other games in Android or app stores, this is making a great achievement. And Apple and Google is very much surprised with this great hit, and which was the unexpected good news. Another main role in our group is Alibaba Group in China. We have now 36.7% in ownership, and we are the major shareholder of this company. You may not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there are some people who may not know much, but as of last year, the transaction volume of Alibaba last year has already exceeded the sum of eBay and Amazon. And actually the growth ratio is much bigger than those two. So this company is the 100% subsidiary \\xe2\\x80\\x93 name is Taobao, and 100% subsidiary of Alibaba, making a rapid growth. About two or three years ago, not much revenue, not much income, so they didn't have much of the interest in making a profitability here probably. But now net income, all of the sudden making a great achievement. So this is net income for quarterly basis. Last year, January to March \\xe2\\x80\\x93 compared to the last year January to March, this has increased by three times. So if you multiply this by four \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or even that the days of the growth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but four times of this number will give you the total net income for full year. So simply put, \\xc2\\xa5200-some billion in net income. But still this company is making a growth, so this full year, net income can be even bigger. That's how I see. So rapid growth in Alibaba is very much expected, and I believe that it's even bigger expectation than you have. As I mentioned earlier, Amazon was also shown as a comparison to Taobao. And Amazon's profit or the growth ratio or the transaction volume of Amazon. So looking at any index, Alibaba exceeding those. And now let me go into the U.S. business growth strategy, which is the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 play the main roles in our [ph] substitute (45:48) of the SoftBank Group, which is U.S. business growth strategy. As I said earlier, acquisition of Sprint completed on July 11th and we believe Japan and United States are similar when it comes to the market \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mobile market, because the network technology is the same and devices \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the mainstream devices are the same. And when we acquired Vodafone K.K., we made full commitment. When we entered mobile communications market, we thought hard about what are the essence or essential to win the mobile market, win in the mobile market. And we came up with four areas of focus. And there are a lot of aspects, as a company to address, but we picked four areas because if we didn't focus on the four areas and instead, if we try to address many different areas, we would not be able to win in market. So that's why we defined four focus areas that are, our network, devices, sales and branding, and service and content. Now, we are making inroads to U.S. market, and again, we defined four focus areas, the same four focus areas because U.S. and Japanese market are the same. And let me use analogy of baseball. Darvish, he is a great pitcher and his speedball could \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with his speedball, he could be successful in United States because he is a baseball player in Japan and he played baseball in the U.S. market, and the baseballs are the same in Japan and United States. And since mobile communication market in Japan and United States are quite similar, so we believe that our four focus area that we worked on in Japan could be the same as the areas that we have to focus on in United States. And first of all, network, the SoftBank network strategy could be applicable to the Sprint because SoftBank's network structure is the same at what Sprint has. From July this year, the Sprint can use 800 megahertz platinum band because the company shut down iDEN network at the end of June and Sprint has 1.9 gigahertz on top and also the Sprint acquired Clearwire's 100% stake, so the Clearwire is now the wholly-owned subsidiary of Sprint. And because of that, Sprint can use 2.5 gigahertz. So the network structure of Sprint is same as that of SoftBank. So of course we start, so with the same network structure, the two companies can share the same devices or handsets. And SoftBank has built its base station network at breakneck speed actually at the fastest speed in the world. And last night, influential \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, I had a dinner meeting with one of the CEO of mobile operator in the world and he was really surprised and impressed by our results of base station build. So our speed of building base stations and network is quite amazing and respectable even by global standards. And as I said earlier, we make then also big data to pinpoint the place to build base stations and we can use that technology and expertise in building the U.S. network as well. And we acquire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, we purchased network equipment and we negotiated with network equipment vendors. And now that we have Sprint, so we can use the economies of scale and so we could improve the CapEx efficiency. And network is one of the challenges that Sprint needs to work on. Actually, it's the most important thing that Sprint needs to work on and we will support that. And second focus area is devices, the TDD-LTE capable handsets, FDD-LTE capable handsets and platinum band capable handsets. Soon, we will see that the same handsets available in Japan could be in use in United States. And to make that happen, we will negotiate with handset vendors, again taking advantage of the economies of scale, and we are going to open a new office in Silicon Valley. In that office \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually, in the same building, the Sprint is planning to open the Sprint Silicon Valley office. And I am planning to go to that Silicon Valley office every month. That office will be the base in United States for my activity. And that office will serve as product development center in cooperation with partners. In that way, we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so we will form a partnership with those companies who have state-of-the-art technology. So utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we will develop the new products. And the third focus area is sales and branding. Right after our acquisition of Vodafone K.K., the company's net addition share was just 4% in Japan. At that time, DOCOMO and KDDI had combined 96% of net addition share. But in 2012, fiscal year 2012, the SoftBank's net addition share was 52%. Acquiring a 52% net addition share in U.S. market is not easy. We know that. But for the past seven years, we have built a lot of expertise and experience in increasing net addition share, so that expertise and experience can be utilized in Japan. Now Sprint last week announced their new price plan for smartphones and that pricing plan includes the unlimited use of data, text and talk. And the price is by far lower than what competitors offer. So the new price plan was announced right after the closing of the Sprint acquisition deal. And also, the new price plan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 another new price plan is for the family. The more lines you add, the lower price will be offered. And Sprint already has operational bases in 30 countries. The Sprint has enterprise customers or corporate customers. So to serve its customers, the Sprint has operational bases in 30 countries. And actually the Sprint owns global network which encompasses 165 countries; none of Japanese companies have such global network. The Sprint has more than 100 years of history in business. During that time, the Sprint has built its own network globally and we believe that our Japanese enterprise customers can utilize that global network. And the fourth focus area is service and content. 10 years ago, the biggest offer of mobile communications was just voice communication and mail. So 10 years ago, the people used mobile phone for the purpose of voice communication and mail. But since then, the mainstream content has changed. Right now, more than 1 million applications are available on the smartphone and the people's lifestyle using mobile phone has changed dramatically. So right now we are in the middle of mobile Internet age. Our competitors started as telecom company, so when they build network, their design concept is based on telecom company's concept. And that leaves us in the packet congestions or communication failure affecting mobile phone users. But we started as Internet company, so when we build a network, we always design a network from the standpoint of Internet communication and data communication. Now that we have acquired Sprint, we will let Sprint share the same corporate culture which design network in the perspective of data communication and mobile network Internet usage. So these are the four focus areas we worked on in Japan and we will focus on these four areas in United States. This year, the Sprint has suffered net operating loss, actually, EBITDA is \\xc2\\xa5500 billion, but EBIT is in the red. But I believe that Sprint will see V shaped recovery soon because we are determined to achieve cost synergies. So this is our fifth focus area. So we will work on four focus areas. On top of that, we will work on the fifth focus area which is cost synergies. And with five focus areas, we can strengthen the Sprint. And we believe that we will see the cost synergies in those four areas. And so far, our mobile EBITDA margin is by far number one in the world. And by focusing on five focus areas, we believe and we are determined to make Sprint a significant turnaround. So I'd like to wrap up my presentation. I'd like to announce the forecast. Here is the forecast for domestic operating income. Our previously announced forecast was exceeding \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in operating income only in domestic business, because after the acquisition of Sprint, we believe that the Sprint's contribution to the consolidated operating income is little because the Sprint will make loss in the first year of acquisition. So we thought that after consolidation of Sprint, we will see that the consolidated operating income including Sprint will be about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion lower. So considering that, we announced previously that the consolidated operating income for 2013 will be \\xc2\\xa5900 billion. But I'd like to announce the upgraded forecast. Even including the Sprint losses, our consolidated operating income for the fiscal year 2013 will exceed \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So I'd like to announce that today. So towards to become number one in the global market we just started and make our forward step towards chapter two and that's already started and as of today, when we see the global operating income ranking compared with the other mobile operator, we are ranked in number six. DOCOMO, we have already exceeded DOCOMO, but when you compare with others, we're still number six. So next year, following years, sometime near future, we would like to rank this up towards, upwards from here, and the way we would like to a firm step towards the upper level of this ranking. So number six in mobile operators, but when it comes to the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all industries operating income ranking, ours is ranked under number 62. So we have to make this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this time, I believe, for now that you may hear this as a dream story, well, big dream, but I am quite determined to become number one sometime in future. So in the last month's Annual General Meeting of shareholders, profit and those numbers are becoming number one in global market. It's not really the ultimate goal, but we have to look at it 300 years and have to keep growing in 300 years and also have to bring the happiness towards our people and to do so that we have to make all the efforts and that is our corporate philosophy. So to achieve such corporate philosophy, we have to become number one in every aspect. So once again, we have revised our consolidated operating income target under IFRS to \\xc2\\xa51 trillion Japanese yen. And also, one of our steps towards global market, U.S. business roll-out begins starting from this month and that is to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for us to become from number one in Japan to number one in the world. So this is the dawn of chapter two. Thank you very much for your attention. \",\n",
       " '2013 Q2': \"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am Son of Softbank. Do you know where the root of the rainbow is? Well, the rainbow starts from at the time of childhood, when I was in the third grade or fourth grade, I often talked with my classmates after the class. We just left school without carrying our bags. Just go to the mountains and play around with friends. And right after the rains at hot summer time, we just saw the rainbow over there. And that was so beautiful that moment and we just wondered where that rainbow comes from. Where the rainbow starts from? Maybe the bottom of the mountain, where the rainbow comes from, we should go and see it. So that was what we have discussed with my classmates for about 10 people together, and we just climbed the hill, went to the mountain. On the way, we thought that we're going to be hungry, so we stopped by at the production plant for bread and we bought some breads, that was like the breads with sugar on and then we eat and also walked around up in the hill to the mountain to find the root of the rainbow. I clearly remember that moment, that the evening around the time that we arrived there we don't see the rainbow anymore and they have been gone. So we have did the same thing several times. So every time we tried to catch the rainbow, and friends that we go together, we sit around and it was very tough time but we're having a fun time together with a lot of dream, to follow the dream. So that was the most exciting moment. We SoftBank have been able to achieve a certain level of the objectives. It was very tough competition and also taking a risk by acquired Vodafone K.K. And once we have quite a bit on a [struck], now that we're entering into U.S. market to taking another risk and making a big challenge here. But every time we tried to catch the rainbow, every time that we have an ambition to see the root of rainbow, we have friends together, we have same occupations and also that excitement, sharing with friends is very important. And that is something that we're able to feel the most joy. So, we have management, board members, and those who are working together with us, employees. Those are the ones that actually saying and sharing with them the same excitement that I had when we tried to catch the rainbow. So, I clearly remember those smiles of the classmates when we had fun together and I believed that is the kind of the thing that we're trying to pursue as a company, SoftBank, for the future challenges. I believe there are lots of challenges ahead, lots of debts ahead, and lots of risk ahead. But still we have friends to share the dream and tried to catch the dream. And I believe that is the most happiest time for myself, and I'm trying to remind myself that this is the best moment of my life. Unfortunately, however, the other day, we lost one friend of ours who has been catching the dreams, it was Mr. Kasai. It was really a hard time and I cried so hard when I heard the news. So, this is the first public presentation after the passing of Mr. Kasai. And I wanted to wear actually a darker tie for the mourning of Mr. Kasai. However, in the morning when I left the house, I just changed my mind because I was not sure if I wear the darker tie Mr. Kasai will not be happy, if I be quiet, If I'm going to be not making a much happy face then Mr. Kasai will not be happy, so probably I should. Once again tried to show myself that I am trying to follow the dream with friends here and also the new friends coming together with us that we are trying to catch the rainbow. That's something that I should show to Mr. Kasai and that will make Mr. Kasai happier. So, because of that thought, I wanted to share and I wore the lighter tie, lighter colors tie, to show that we still have an motivation to catch the dream. This is just the beginning that the venture of Softbank just started. So that's how I feel right now. So now, let me go into my presentation and to share with you the middle path of our way to our dreams. So here we have \\xc2\\xa52.6 trillion net sales for the first half, a 73% increase year-on-year, record high EBIT of \\xc2\\xa5715.1 billion, first time exceeding \\xc2\\xa5700 billion and also 67% increase in year-on-year basis. Net income also coming close to \\xc2\\xa5400 billion. Year-on-year comparison wise, this is 84% increase. Comparing this to competitors of those two companies, which is DOCOMO and KDDI, and that those announcement was made the other day. So I show you as a comparison chart. And this is the first time since our foundation of the company we have exceeded the numbers of net sales, EBIT, net income in every aspect we were able to exceed DOCOMO. Right after the acquisition of Vodafone, I said in 10 years we will be exceeding DOCOMO, which was the dominant number one back then in the market. And that was my public announcement, but then even our employees or even our management was laughing. This is not possible. That was too much big dream. So that's how those people thought. But actually in terms of number of customers, in terms of net sales, net EBIT, or net income we were able to exceed DOCOMO and we became number one. And into more details, we have a yellow portion here on the bar chart, which is the Sprint segment and Sprint has been included from this time earnings results announcement. And so in here, people may say that you just exceed the DOCOMO because of Sprint. You have a kind of just additions here it doesn't make sense that you say exceeding DOCOMO by just adding Sprint. But still I say it's okay. We can just add it. Anything is okay. Exceeding is exceeding. So we just exceed DOCOMO. What we're trying to do is trying to catch the dream. Even though I am small, then why don't we just wear taller shoes if I cannot reach, why don't we use ladders? Anything that if we can have a tool, why shouldn't we use it to reach the dream? Of course, it should be under the legal rules and should be appropriate for any accounting rules. So no any force matters, but in any ways now we can use any tools, any aspect, we should think about it then we should use it if it is appropriate. In net sales here, we have just exceeded the competitors. EBITDA, this is the EBITDA which is the good indicator for European countries and U.S., while operating income is more an important indicator in Japan. But here, we have increased by 39% and a record high for 10 consecutive period. And next you see EBIT, which is operating income. Again, that they're exceeding \\xc2\\xa5700 billion, which is a record high for eight consecutive periods. Increasing by 67%, but you see yellow portion below there, it was a negative contributions this fiscal year, this period. But the next time around that the way we believe that it's going to be making a contribution. But this time again, that we have another additions, a one-time gain from making GungHo and WILLCOM subsidiaries. Again, you may say that this is another excuse we will be able to record high. But still, even though we take this one-time gain out from this bar, we are making a steady increasing trend from \\xc2\\xa5429 billion to \\xc2\\xa5488 billion. So even taking out this one-time gain, still we've been exceeding the previous year result. So outpaced DOCOMO and KDDI, but again, this includes the one-time gain. Although, it is including one-time gain, but the \\xc2\\xa5715 billion here, if we take the one-time gain out from here, but still actually we outpaced DOCOMO for the first time that is this period's results. So we do use the several auditions, but even without those, we're making a steady growth. And I believe that I was thinking that this is just a matter of time, but finally, even taking out one-time gain that we'll be able to exceed DOCOMO. So, everything all included we made a significant growth. So, domestic EBIT ranking here, this is the absolute amount of the EBIT. We were able to exceed NTT as well NTT DOCOMO, Honda, KDDI and became number two after following Toyota. After the Lehman stock trouble, we were told that the SoftBank and the Japan Airline was the most likely bankrupting company and many media wrote about it. And I believe some of the analysts or some of the media people are thinking and writing that the SoftBank is most likely to bankrupt. And actually Japan Airline did bankrupted but we, our case didn't bankrupt but actually became number two in terms of EBITDA, EBIT. How about the global EBIT ranking? We are ranked 24th. And this is a global ranking across all the industries. Not only the telecom industry but also all the sectors of business and we are ranked number 24th in the world. Global financial crisis in 2008 after the Lehman Brothers collapsed, we were called as a company which is likely to go bankrupt, but actually we are ranked number 24th in terms of EBIT ranking in the world. And here is the global EBIT growth rate ranking across all the sector or business in the world. And those companies with more than \\xc2\\xa57 trillion market cap and we are ranked number three. Here is net income, we begin with a record again marking the 84% year-on-year increase. In terms of net income, we outpaced our two rivals in this industry. Our rivals recorded the flat net income, but actually, well, in 2005 in the first half of that year, our net income was in the negative territory, but right now, our net income is the highest in this industry. And maybe if you look at all the industry in Japan, this much growth is pretty rare. So, this is the summary of the consolidated earnings results. Across all the KPIs here, we made strong results in this period. And here is cash flow. Out of cash flow results, here is operating cash flow. As you can see, we are making steady growth in operating cash flow. When we acquired Vodafone's Japan's operation, the next interest bearing debt to EBITDA multiple was 6.2 times. And that speaks for the fact that our acquisition of Vodafone Japan's operation was pretty risky. But actually, this time, we took the leverage when we acquired Sprint and the latest multiple is 3.2 times. Well, from the 6.2 times, our multiple improved significantly. And right after the Vodafone's acquisition, our share price fell sharply. It's about 60% fall within one-week after the announcement of the Vodafone's acquisition. But as for the Sprint acquisition, right after the announcement, our share price fell by 25% in a couple of days, 25% fall. So, when I saw that, I thought that investors and analysts learned what would happen, learned and understand what would happen in SoftBank's business even after the Sprint acquisition. Well, the 25% drop of share price is unusual and that's because many people worried about our acquisition. But still a lot of people didn't have much worry about acquisition of Sprint. So, that's why the share price didn't fall automatically right after the Vodafone Japan's operation. And after the announcement, there is a growing confidence or optimistic view around the investors and analysts about the future of the SoftBank and Sprint acquisition. So, we'd like to paying down the debts in the most efficient way as soon as possible. We refinanced the acquisition, finance of Sprint, and the interest rate for the permanent finance is 1.4%. When we acquired Vodafone's Japan's operation, the average borrowing cost was about 3.8%. But this time, it's 1.4%. That's substantially lower borrowing cost. So that's the overview of our business. So, let me focus on Mobile Communications segment. A lot of people worried that the SoftBank's business results will be worsened because the DOCOMO launched iPhone. So the SoftBank is no longer the sole player selling iPhone. Before the iPhone 5s and 5c launch we've done a survey, actually [indiscernible] survey. And according to the survey results, the 60% of the consumer would buy iPhone from DOCOMO, but after the launch, here's the sales share and we got the biggest sales share. So in 2006, we acquired Vodafone's Japan operation and prior to that, the DOCOMO in au was number one in net additions. Now, one year after our acquisition of Vodafone's operation, the SoftBank became number one in net additions because SoftBank released the Family Plan or White Plan and so on. So even before the SoftBank launched iPhone, the SoftBank became number one in net additions. So contrary to what many people believe, the SoftBank was number one in net additions even before the launch of iPhone. So, after we launched the iPhone as a sole provider of iPhone in Japan, the SoftBank won the net addition number one position but then came KDDI joining us selling iPhone. But still, even after the KKDI's launch of iPhone, the SoftBank constantly became number one in net additions. And a lot of people worried about the SoftBank's position in net additions, number one, after the DOCOMO's launch of iPhone, but actually, even after the DOCOMO's launch of iPhone, we were number one. Net additions is important KPI because number of subscribers times ARPU makes the telecom revenue. So just having a strong net addition is not sufficient or just having a strong ARPU figure is not enough. We need both. So, here is net additions. Of the SoftBank's net addition, some of them are the EMOBILE's and WILLCOM's net additions. So if we add the EMOBILE net addition and WILLCOM net addition, the total net addition for the April-September period was 1.91 million, which is overwhelmingly number one. And here is, MNP net additions, this is another important indicator and our net addition through MNP doubled year-on-year this time. And this is another important KPI ARPU. Right after our acquisition of Vodafone's Japan's operation, our ARPU was by far lower than that of DOCOMO and au, but we launched the White Plan and other initiatives. And as a result, the DOCOMO's and au started seeing the decline of ARPU. We successfully make that happen. So judging from this trend, I think that DOCOMO's and au's ARPU declining trend have not stopped yet. au's MNP is showing a strong result, but yet what is important for the mobile sales revenue is both ARPU and net additions. Our ARPU has been on a steady trend, but our labeled ARPU has been on the declining trend. That's the difference. And because of our steady ARPU trend and the net additions trend, our mobile service revenue has been increasing consistently every year. And because of that, our EBITDA margin has been improving significantly, it's 52%. So, 52% out of sales is EBITDA margin rate. And that EBITDA margin 52% is number one in the world. So, nearly half of the sales is counted as EBITDA. 52% EBITDA margin is by far the highest across all the mobile operators in the world. So, the growth rate is number one and margin rate is also number one. As a result, our mobile EBIT is strong. When we acquired Vodafone's Japan operation, the company saw the declining trends of EBIT. And if we wait one year more, then the company might have gone bankrupt, but actually we acquired that operation. But we knew the performance of the Vodafone's Japan operation, but we didn't delay the acquisition because we thought that that was a right timing to acquire the company because we wanted to be in time for the mobile Internet business start. And before the acquisition, I told Mr. Steve Jobs of Apple, and I asked Mr. Jobs to allow SoftBank to sell iPhone; even before Apple announced or unveiled the iPhone, I met Mr. Steve Jobs and asked to allow SoftBank to sell iPhone as the sole operator in Japan. And we started meeting and with my promise to sell the iPhone, I spent nearly \\xc2\\xa52 trillion to acquire Vodafone's Japan's operation back then. I'm not stupid enough to go on fighting without weapon or tools. I just kept secrets of having a good weapon and tactics, and with the preparation for the fighting, I became confident that I could make this business successful, so that's why I acquired Vodafone's Japan's operation and right now, the mobile EBIT increased eight times from the acquisition. So, towards the number one network in the smartphone era, what will be the important factors? Well, the older mobile operators are offering the same device, and now we are in the smartphone era, so what will be the right network in the smartphone era? Well, in that era, it is very important to be number one in smartphone connectivity and also it's important to be number one in high-speed service. So the smartphone connectivity and high-speed service, those are the two crucial factors for network in the smartphone era. So to improve the smartphone connectivity what we will do? We built the base stations. Our competitors owned 800 megahertz platinum band, but at that time, we didn't have license to use platinum band before. In Japan, the spectrum is not auctioned. The regulatory agency grants permission or a license to mobile operators or telecom operators. And back then, we didn't get granted license. That was a great handicap. And because of that, the SoftBank people said that SoftBank connectivity was poorer, such public image is still persistent. But we wanted to overcome that handicap and that's why we built base stations at a furious pace. And then, we finally got granted the platinum band license. So even without the platinum band license, we continuously built base stations. And after we were finally granted the platinum band, we have built our base stations for platinum band at a furious pace. As a result, DOCOMO and au and this is us three-and-a-half years ago. So the red areas are the one that we have coverage. White are like a mountain area so that we don't have an coverage there. And you can see we have less coverage area compared to those two, as you can see from this map. But as of today, as a matter of fact, so please look at this area. Others will not change, it's only this one. How about this? Really, that's three-and-a-half years ago. And as of today, here we go. You can see that the red portion increased, the SoftBank is now having a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there have been say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we said that we have to have a better coverage and we did have every effort to have a better coverage. And as you can see, SoftBank looks like more a red area than those two. Don't you think so? So when you look closer, this is the Tokyo or Kanto area which have about one-third of the population in Japan and this Tokyo, Kanto area is carrying the one-third of the population. This is three-and-a-half years ago and as of today, here we go. You can see that the red area increased. So, if you compare with two competitors, you can see which has the best coverage, you can see at a glance So, three-and-a-half years ago, we were so white and now much better. So, the area with the connectivity increased. Maybe you cannot tell only looking at the map, so I will make it to the graph then. This is the data connectivity rate of the comparison of the three. So, there are about 1 billion datas from smartphones and DOCOMO and au, iPhone and Android and those application that we can have a fair survey amongst three companies. The higher is the better in SoftBank. Here we go. We have the far better than those two in terms of data connectivity. Maybe only the graph doesn't really give you a good sense. It's not yet 100% and that is because those who turn off their handsets while sleeping, that also count as well, or in the middle of tunnel or you are turning off the mobile phone, that does include as an minus counted. So it's very kind of a tough survey. So when it comes to the specific places, railway stations, university, shopping malls in each area with this 1 billion of data, the golf course or the beaches or the ski sites. Those that we haven't been able to compete. However, recently we have every day calculation, every day site survey and in every segment we are now have a clean sweep and having a best data connectivity rate. And maybe because there are several handsets for this time, because iPhone 5s and the 5c has launched by DOCOMO, so we can use the same handset available in each three carriers. Therefore that we have au using 800 LTE, so they're saying that they are the number one with their marketing right now, but as a matter of fact, with using the same iPhone 5s and 5c, au is the bottom. And DOCOMO actually does marketing too much but the better results than au. That's the result from our survey. So using the same handset as on 5s and 5c, so that the same handsets available in three operators right now, so that we can do the fair survey of network. And here is the results from SoftBank and this is what we have, exactly same handset and provide customer our best data connectivity. And this is a result, scientific analysis of results. So those data is the packet or the data connectivity. So when it comes to the core connectivity for the voice calls, this is the result. Again, between the smartphone a comparison amongst the operators, so, some of the part, we are behind, when you consider conventional handset, but there are customers who are thinking to migrate to smartphone. I believe smartphone comparison is appropriate here. So, that before the smartphone era and after the smartphone era, SoftBank experience is totally different for customers. And also networks shouldn't have any trouble for customers. Competitors actually work out with the major incident, that must be reported to the minister, but we have no serious network incident so far for 889 days. As far as we know, this is the longest record for not having serious network incident and also we are making a progress for that. And next important agenda is the speed. We've been deploying TD-LTE base stations and now that we have the best speed. And in addition to that, we've been increasing FDD-LTE base stations and also double LTE at double speed by the acquisition of EMOBILE. And 5x5 speed has been increased to 10x10 with LTE. As a result, 5x5 times we were behind DOCOMO and au in terms of speed. But after the double speed with double LTE, we have now exceeded the competitors or catching up with the competitors. So those area, is condensed with people like railway stations we pick up 500 stations surveyed by the company called Cross Marketing, surveyed top 500 stations by number of daily commuters in Japan. And the 427 stations out of 500, we were number one in terms of speed and no packet congestion. And actually the speed itself is twice as fast as competitors and that was also surveyed under iPhone 5c, the same handset with competitors for the survey. And not only faster, but twice as fast as competitors. And in Sprint we will be using 900 megahertz, so that it's going to give us a triple LTE. But at the same time, it does require the CapEx. In five years, we have plan for CapEx, but we kind of bring ahead the schedules for these two years, but we are heading out. In the domestic business performance, we have no worries. We have a steady increase \\xe2\\x80\\x93 steady growth, as you can see from the presentation. But when it comes to years, how about that, that's a new challenge that we have. After the shutdown of iDen network and also some difficulty network connectivity, net additions are declining. However, here we hit the bottom and recently we completed this transaction. And now it's turning around. The sales approach, sales know-hows, we will agree we need to spend about a year to share such best-practices. But spending about a year, we believe we'll be able to improve the network and also the sales approach can be improved so that we will be able to be on the turning around trend. I say one year is necessary, but after passing one year, I believe the landscape is going to be different. Number of users are decreasing; however, ARPU is making a steady increase. In the smartphone ratios, sales mix is now highest ever. As a result, service revenue is making a steady growth. And also the EBITDA is hitting a bottom again to making the turning around sign. And here are the specific agenda for the growth of Sprint. One is the making the network improve, catching up with the competitor and even exceeds the competitors in two years. How we're going to exceed them is the question because we have shut down the iDen network so that the 850 megahertz Platinum Band is now available which can be available for smartphone so that they we will be improve the coverage area. And when it comes to capacity and speed, we have the biggest continuous spectrum like the 2.5 gigahertz for the Clearwire, average 120 megahertz of band available nationwide. So acquiring this not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we only be buying the Sprint, which means that we are buying the company without any weapon. But also we have Sprint with the enterprise value of \\xc2\\xa51.4 trillion not only Sprint's acquisition. If Clearwire is not available for Sprint, then I didn't decide to buy or acquire Sprint. And if we didn't have a verbal communication with Steve, having iPhone available in our hand. And if there is no such communication with him, I wouldn't buy Vodafone. And that this time the transaction, the spectrum, the Clearwire is that much important. In early stage, I didn't make any comments about the acquisition of Clearwire because that could make a bidding competition, so that's why that I hesitate to make any comments. However, 120 megahertz spectrum held by Clearwire, which is the best spectrum that they have can be a very good weapon for the battle in the market, whether that we will be able to have this or not. In all the preparation to be able to have such it makes me good confident into the acquisition of Sprint. Therefore, we believe that we're going to have good improvements of the network going forward and also the OpEx efficiencies, those expenses for operations, about \\xc2\\xa5200 billion annual efficiency can be available and we have a good plan for that. And the handset procurement cost reduction is another point, which we have well planned for it. In the following slide that I'm going to talk is about the acquisition of Brightstar. And I believe this has a big meaning for that. We've been preparing for this about six months, and we have announced that recently. And also the sales enhancement, something like we have in our sales approach, good practices, best practices that we would like to share with Sprint for about coming year or so. So, with these four points and the four initiatives that we're very confident that we can make a Sprint turnaround. So, SoftBank and Sprint is now in one team and we would like to operate in one team mind. So the other day we have all the directors and our people together in the same place and I made a presentation as one team, one vision. So, we will be the one team to achieve our objectives. So, becoming one team and sharing one vision, and we will catching the rainbow all together and share such vision is the first starting point. We don't think we are telecom operator. We are Internet company. That's our core business. We are Internet company. While the Internet world was PC-centric but there's a shift from PC to mobile device. The media of the Internet is shifting to mobile device and that's why I decided to acquire Vodafone Japan's operations and mobile communication operator is the infrastructure to pursue the mobile Internet business. And of course, to be the good Internet company, we are investing in the content companies and other Internet businesses. So, all the companies under our umbrella are necessary to make a greater Internet company. So, we are going towards number one content company in a smartphone era. And we are aiming to be the global number one in e-commerce. In the recent Yahoo! Japan's event, we announced the new initiative. But Yahoo! Japan installed a new management last year, and without the new management team, the initiative to re-accelerate the growth would never be achieved. And the new management headed by their Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son is doing a good job so far to create a base for the re-acceleration of the growth. And the e-commerce is crucial for Yahoo! Japan. And in order to strengthen the e-commerce business, Yahoo! Japan recently announced a new initiative which was totally unconventional in this industry of e-commerce. Yahoo! Japan charge their tenants in their e-commerce site as a monthly fee and also they charge their sales royalty, but they eliminate such fee charging. Also Yahoo! announced that they will allow all the tenants to make e-mails to the customers or lead customers to their own website. Now, the purpose of that is to increase the number of tenants or stores in the Yahoo!'s e-commerce site. There are a lot of e-commerce tenants or merchants like, those are the tenants or merchants in the shopping mall. And in order to include or strengthen the e-commerce business, it's very important to have a large number of stores. For the past 10 years, Yahoo! has been striving to increase the number of stores or merchants in the e-commerce site. But they want to make a drastic change in that situation. They wanted to break through the stalemate and the as the Chairman of Yahoo! Japan, I made the announcement early in this month and I announced Japan's initiative of e-commerce revolution as the Chairman of Yahoo! Japan. So, after the announcement of free-of-charge tenantship, the number of stores in Yahoo! shopping sites increased sharply. Before the announcement, number of stores was 20,000, but since the announcement just in two weeks, the number hit 75,000. This includes those who haven't opened their store yet. It takes a few weeks or maybe a few months at the longest, but we are receiving application from the potential tenants one after another. So, including those applications our potential tenants, the Yahoo! Japan's number of tenants is by far larger than that of our rivals. Once this e-commerce site has the larger number of site tenants and merchants, a lot of visitors or customers will visit the e-commerce sites and that could result in the generation or creation of business opportunity. So, increasing the number of stores was very important. And here is Yahoo! Auctions situation, the number of auction stores increased 30 times. So, I believe that the Yahoo! Auction business will increase the profit from now on at the furious speed. So, by the year 2020, maybe within six years or seven years from now, the Yahoo! would become number one in terms of product lineup, as well as the e-commerce transaction value. That's what Yahoo! Japan is aiming to achieve and I'm confident that Yahoo! Japan could fulfill the goal. So, that's a totally unconventional business model, but would that business model sustain, because there is no charge for the tenants or merchants. Could such unconventional business model really work? Actually, there is another company which has adopted such business model. The name of the company is Taobao. That's a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alibaba. This is a 50/50 joint venture established by Alibaba and SoftBank. And Taobao is number one in the world in terms of product lineup and e-commerce transaction value. Please look at these numbers. This is about the transaction volume. The global transaction volume of eBay and Amazon are \\xc2\\xa57.5 trillion and \\xc2\\xa56.1 trillion, respectively. But the Taobao's transaction volume last year was \\xc2\\xa516.1 trillion. So, the number exceeds the combined transaction volume of eBay and Amazon and the growth is still continuing. And look at this growth rate. eBay's growth rate is 10%, Amazon's was 27%, but Taobao's transaction volume growth rate year-on-year was 64%. So, the transaction volume-wise, Taobao is number one and the growth rates-wise, Taobao is number one. But they don't charge the merchant any monthly charge or royalty, but are they making income? Actually, until recently, Taobao didn't generate profit. But recent three years, the net income is increasing and the recent net income was \\xc2\\xa5137.6 billion, and net income growth rate year-on-year was 179% compared to just 4% of eBay and minus 45% of Amazon. So, Yahoo! Japan announced no charge to the merchant and tenants, and Yahoo! Japan said that they would make income from, or money out of the advertising business. And actually, Yahoo! Japan's new business model would work based on the results produced by Alibaba. Now here is next topic. Winners in mobile games will become winners in mobile content, that's what we believe. On iPhone platform and Android platform, nearly one million titles of applications ranging from cooking, recipe application, news application or business tool, travel, health aids, guides, lots of varieties of applications are available. But gaming application generates more than 80% of revenue Google Play and nearly 80% are in the Apple Store. So income-wise, then that's revenue and income-wise, I think that 90% of the income of applications are from game applications. So, smartphone content, when it comes to smartphone content, the game is the crucial content. So, the winners in the mobile game content will become the winners in mobile game will become winners in mobile content. And the mobile game market is expected to continue to grow, so we are aiming to be global number one in mobile games. And that's why we decided to consolidate GungHo Online Entertainment in our book and here is the GungHo's EBIT. As you can see in this graph, the EBIT of GungHo increased significantly in the July-September periods GungHo's EBIT was made quarter-over-quarter decrease, so as market thought that the GungHo's revenue or income increase just stop there. But actually that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don't think so. The income growth or revenue growth is just the beginning, at the beginning stage. And out of GungHo's sales, 90% is from Japan and remaining 10% are from Korea. So, obviously, market is where the GungHo's income would generate upside. But so far the GungHo doesn't have the expertise in global marketing and global sales. So, that's why we decided to make investment in Supercell, which is global number one, global game company. Here is the transaction structure are jointly with GungHo, the SoftBank became the 51% shareholder of Supercell. Supercell is a new hero in the SoftBank Group and we have the new CEO of the new hero here in Japan. I'd like to introduce Mr. Ilkka Paananen, please come forward to this podium. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Ilkka Paananen, CEO of Supercell. He will make a presentation in English, so for those Japanese speakers, please put the receiver in Japanese translation. So as you see, GungHo is making their global development together with Supercell. And I believe that Supercell is going to be their great support. And the GungHo so far is making most revenue out of Japan and also number one revenue in the globe. So GungHo is going towards global market as far as Supercell having the best revenue out of our users which has the upside, meaning that GungHo is larger in terms of revenue by user and that we'll be able to ramp over the business model of Supercell. Supercell can expand its business and also that they just started the Android reach starting from this month until then that it was only available in April. But now that Android is available, so that -and also new titles they expect in sometime next year, so that I believe Supercell having a great potentials in upside, and GungHo as well with its partnership this time, they will have a good reach to the global market . And also relating the new titles. In addition to that partnership, as I mentioned earlier little bit, we're going to be number one in terms of number of handset purchase. The SoftBank, Sprint and also Brightstar. So, I think all those, we will be about twice as much bigger in terms of wireless device compared to the number two. Compared to the Verizon and AT&T's purchase volume, ours is two times or three times more. Compared to KDDI, 10 times more, and compared to DOCOMO at five times. So we gain the scale as a buyer of handsets. What's the benefit to us? With such scale, as a handset buyers, we could enjoy various benefits and we'd like to report all the benefit later. And here is the structure and we will start with the 57% stake in Brightstar, but we will increase the stake up to 70%. That's what we have agreed. And so, we are strengthening our content business and asset procurement, and network enhancement. Those three areas we're pursuing to strengthen. We could be a number one and we are aiming to be number one in the world. So let me wrap up this presentation. Our domestic business is on track for further growth, steadily, consistently. And our U.S. business has started with negative profit, thus bring to a consolidated from this quarter. But the consolidated operating income was negative. So, start from negative territory. But we already experienced that when we acquired Vodafone's Japan's operation. So, we are going to turn around the Sprint business. If we fail to turn around the Sprint and then \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually that would not happen, and I stake my pride in turning around that U.S. business. Like I said earlier, the Sprint will make negative contribution in terms of operating profit. But even with the negative contribution of Sprint in operating income, we are sure that our operating income for this fiscal year will hit \\xc2\\xa51 trillion as I announced earlier. But \\xc2\\xa51 trillion operating income includes about \\xc2\\xa5250 billion of one-time gains. Yet, here is our forecast for the fiscal year 2014. Without one-time gains, we would like to hit \\xc2\\xa51 trillion mark in EBIT. Again, it's without one-time gain. So net sales \\xc2\\xa57 trillion, EBITDA \\xc2\\xa52 trillion, and EBIT \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. \\xc2\\xa57 trillion, \\xc2\\xa52 trillion, \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, simple numbers, please remember these numbers. Again, net sales \\xc2\\xa57 trillion, EBITDA \\xc2\\xa52 trillion, and EBIT results one-time gain \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So for this fiscal year, our EBIT that includes one-time gain of \\xc2\\xa5250 billion, but in the next fiscal year EBIT excluding results one-time gain means that our EBIT will increase by 30% year-on-year. Here is my promise. In fiscal 2014, we will achieve EBIT of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. In other words, 30% year-on-year increase of EBIT without one-time gain. But that's not our final, ultimate goal. Our ultimate goal is to be number one in every aspect. Like I said earlier in this presentation, we are still in a quest of a rainbow. We are trying to find the place where the rainbow starts. But we are filled with excitement to find the foot of the rainbow. And the reason why is that we'd like to bring the rainbow to everyone in the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 dream like a rainbow. We'd like to bring the dream like a rainbow to the people in the world, not only adults but also the children, especially underserved children, we'd like to bring the dream like a rainbow. Thank you very much for your kind attention.\",\n",
       " '2013 Q3': \"My name is Son. Thank you very much for joining our earnings call today. Thank you. At the time of childhood when you have a field trip, you have to walk for about [ph] hours (02:00) and visiting mountains and so on. And then you look back, and see, you find yourself you've been walking quite a long way. That happens quite a lot. And we've been spending for about 30-some years since our establishment of the business and after the IPO, this is just our 20th year anniversary. So past 20 years, looking back, is just like yesterday. It happened like yesterday. And seems like it's a little bit of quite on a long way that we've been working through. So let me go through with the presentation to walk the same mile. 20 years ago, like I said, 20 years ago, we just went public and this is the 20th anniversary since its IPO. And this is a photo from 10 years ago. I was very young in this photo, I was really young back then. And External Director of SoftBank and also business leader, who I respected, who is Mr. Yanai of FAST RETAILING, CEO. And our ticker number is 9984 in the Tokyo Stock Exchange and I believe the FAST RETAILING ticker number is 9983. So one number before us for the IPO. So just one before us, so exactly the same day, we went public with FAST RETAILING. So we went public on the same day and we were receiving the letters \\xe2\\x80\\x93 notice from Tokyo Stock Exchange that time. And that time, we start competing as an entrepreneurs and we've been working hard. And recently, he's been serving as a board of directors of SoftBank and giving us a lot of advices. So that back in 1994, this is really familiar photo for me. And since then, net sales in the past 20 years, it became 100 times; EBIT or operating income 300 times. So actually EBIT grew bigger than net sales. And there in the middle of the course, we have started the broadband and we start competing against NTT to provide broadband service. And that time, it was all in red and there are some speculations about our bankruptcy. And at that time, the Internet bubble collapsed and our stock price went to 100 in one year. So there was the situation back then, and we turned around from there. And looking back, what we had was just [ph] rounding era (05:36) for me. These are just very small, minor things when we look back now. That time, it was like dead or alive type of situation. But looking the past 20 years, we have already grown 300 times in terms of operating income. And our market cap became 50 times as mentioned earlier. At the time of Internet bubble, it made about \\xc2\\xa520 trillion and went down to [ph] 100 (06:05). And counting from the peak that we came back to, about a half of that peak time, but the operating income became 300 times. Net sales also became 100 times. So market cap compared to the time of IPO, it needs to be grow even further. A \\xc2\\xa59 trillion of market cap when we compare with the global market cap ranking, we ranked number 81. So in one word, we are still in the process or we are still in the path to further growth. We are not satisfied yet. Our business still continues to grow. And this is just about the starting time and we are becoming a full-fledged growing period going forward. So that's how I view our current situation and our position. Now that I would like to go into consolidated earnings results. Our highlights, 94% increase in net sales. In EBIT, 46% increase. Net income, 58% increase. And I want you to see in the graph, this is the net sales, of course, inside of this, this includes the acquisition of Sprint. This is shown in lighter gray and you can see that there are big jump here because of that. But when you look closer, even without the Sprint segment that we are making a steady growth here in net sales. And next one is EBIT, this is before the depreciation. And this, again, is making increase of 49%. And breakdown of that, you see the Sprint segment included here in the bar. But once again, if you look closer, without the Sprint segment, but still we are making steady growth in EBITDA, by SoftBank itself. Same applies to EBIT, GungHo, WILLCOM, those one-time gains included here in the bar, but without these one-time gain, but still, we are making a continuous growth here again. So for this fiscal year, fiscal year 2014, starting from April, we would like to achieve the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of operating income without any one-time gain. And net income, 58% increase, \\xc2\\xa5488 billion. And this shows the summary of the consolidated earnings results. And when we compare with our competitors, DOCOMO, KDDI, here you can see, and as you can tell, in the past seven years or so or probably eight years, we've been struggling. And DOCOMO, actually also, was flat in the past eight years, both net sales and the operating income. Both way, they were flat. Eight years ago, SoftBank's net operating income or EBIT was nearly zero. And around that time, we acquired Vodafone's Japan operation and since then our business has grown rapidly. So looking back the past seven and eight years, well, back then, eight years ago, we were far behind the top two companies. But eight years later, since then, we exceeded the KDDI's results. A lot of people said that SoftBank did a window dressing accounting, but actually that was not true. We produced results and we are still producing results. And growth is still continuing. In Japan's market, all three carriers, major carriers are selling iPhone, and competition is becoming intense. So it's not really easy for us to keep growing our income like we did, but we always try to find solutions to overcome difficulties. If solution A doesn't work, we try to find solution B or C. So we always succeeded in finding solution for growth. That's what we have done so far. And we have continuously grown in Japan's markets. And from now on, we would like to grow our business in United States. Please look at net income. The growth is more dramatic than the EBIT growth curve. So in terms of net sales, EBIT and net income, SoftBank results were better than that of competitors. And here is cash flow summary and our debt increased. When we are acquired Vodafone's Japan operation, net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA multiple rose to 6.2 times. Now post-Sprint acquisition, our multiple is 3.5 times. And we are determined to bring down this number to lower level. We made borrowings, but when it comes to borrowing, the total amount of borrowing doesn't matter. How much you borrowed doesn't matter. What matters is whether or not you can pay down the debt and you can generate the income to pay down the debt. And based on that idea, we should look at the multiple. And if, as soon as you can increase the EBITDA, you could improve the debt/EBITDA multiple very soon. So we always look at the debt/EBITDA multiple. And with that in mind, we do investment or we do acquisitions. And so far, I talked about the overall SoftBank business, but from now on, I'd like to focus on domestic business. In the past, people said that if DOCOMO were to launch iPhone, SoftBank would face the biggest crisis in the company's history. Of course, before DOCOMO joining us in selling iPhone, KDDI started selling iPhone. Even after KDDI's launch of iPhone, the SoftBank kept growing its revenue and profit. Before DOCOMO's launch of iPhone, there was a survey asking consumers which operators do they want to buy a new iPhone from. And this result [indiscernible] (14:48), but it turned out that 40% of consumers bought their iPhones from SoftBank. So we overcame the last crisis in domestic market by exceeding iPhone market share that of DOCOMO. So in Japan's market for six consecutive years, we were number one in terms of net additions. Even before we launched iPhone, we were number one. And even after our competitors started selling iPhone, we remained number one in terms net additions. So whatever happens, we try hard to overcome the difficulties and we always produce results. So this is the SoftBank group's net additions including EMOBILE and WILLCOM. And net addition of SoftBank group for the past nine months is \\xc2\\xa54.1 million which is by far a larger number than competitors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that of competitors. We were determined to beat DOCOMO in terms of total subscriber and DOCOMO subscriber was over 60 million. But as of December, end of last year, the SoftBank group's total subscribers hit 100 million mark, both in Japan and United States. So we hit 100 million mark in terms of subscribers. So we don't care about 50,000 net addition per month, while we don't care if there's any ups and down in net addition per month or in mobile number portability results. 10,000 to 100,000 increase or decrease is regarded as margin of error \\xe2\\x80\\x93 within margin of error. We always look at the SoftBank's total number of subscribers. And we don't care about the partial optimization, but we always try to optimize the group-wide operation and results. So our number of subscribers doubled since our acquisition of Vodafone Japan operations in Japan. Actually, number of subscribers increased by 2.5 times compared to that of eight years ago. But please look at ARPU, it being about the same level for the past eight years in contrast with sharp decline of ARPU of competitors. So we have been maintaining a recent level of ARPU for the past eight years. And that's why our total operating income or service revenue has been growing. Competitors' number of subscribers are increasing, but still their income is not growing very much because their ARPU has been on the declining trend for the past eight years. So I went to field trip when I was a kid, and I looked back and I found myself traveled a long way. But actually it happened in the SoftBank's past eight years. And right now, the mobile service revenue growth rate is number one across all the global players and margin rate is also improving; even compared in the global markets, our mobile EBITDA margin is the highest. Since our acquisition of Vodafone's Japan operation, mobile EBIT grew 9 times, again 9 times increase of mobile EBIT. The Vodafone's Japan operation lost EBIT rapidly and significantly. It was like a sunken ship. And if we didn't acquire the Vodafone Japan's operation, the company went bankrupt. So I will say that that was a big risk and our stock price went down by 65% at the time. That was because we acquired a company who is falling with trillions of Japanese yen, and that was the big reason why many people concerned about the situation. However, we made several efforts to the business so that now that we've been reaching 9 times of the mobile EBIT. And here shows the mobile EBIT growth rate. And once again, we even compare with Verizon and AT&T in the United States. We are very high in terms of mobile EBIT growth rate. So here in the net additions, and also in terms of mobile EBIT, we've been making a great growth here. And up to here, which is already very well familiar with you, and looking back, it looks like a natural story to all of us, but when we were there at that moment, that was very much unexpected situation. So one question I have to you, so once that we lose the exclusivity of iPhone sales in Japanese market, then SoftBank, who is not very good at Android sales and with the competitors start selling iPhone, what happens to SoftBank? That was the question. And you see we have recovered with our sales with Android. So even in Android, the sale of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Android handset sales was very much low compared to the competitors. But now, we regained the momentum. And comparing the January of 2013 and 2014 in the past one year, only spending a year and we've been able to became number one on Android handset sales share for new additions. Of course, in our line-ups, in the SoftBank's definition, we include EMOBILE and WILLCOM. So it's not the PHS, the personal handy-service and not including any Wi-Fi routers, [indiscernible] (22:50) the Android smartphone. And we were able to exceed DOCOMO and au. So it looks like we're adding those from EMOBILE and WILLCOM, but why not, I would say. It is SoftBank group. So, whatever the brand name is, they are a member of SoftBank group. And with the sales share of Android, we were very much behind competitors. And now that we bring it back to better, much better position compared to the competitors. So now that we have iPhone sales by every operators, and now that we are achieving as the number one sales share in Android. And that's how we can describe our kind of move here. In the broadband going forward, fixed and the mobile, there are several way of broadband. But we say the main source of the broadband is coming out from mobile LTE. So for this part that we would like to focus \\xe2\\x80\\x93 keep focusing and grow. And that is why this time we have announced a new flat-rate plan, because mobile is now transit from the voice use to data use. And going forward, there will be more and more focus on voice over LTE or VoLTE. So that going forward, using the data LTE network, the service or the voice will be provided on voice over LTE, so that voice is only the member or one part of the packet for the data. So now that's why we have decided to start providing the substantially free-of-charge for the voice, meaning that within 5 minutes, per person, per month, a customer can make a call of thousands. And for the voice call, making more than 1,000 calls, is there anyone who's making more than 1,000 calls in a month? I don't believe so. Probably, we have about some hundreds of people here in this venue and out of this some hundreds of analysts, journalists, out of all those, I believe that no one is making call more than 1,000 times for voice calls. So for the most of the people, this is substantially free of charge for the voice. As you know, Android's basic charge for data is \\xc2\\xa5 6,900 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, \\xc2\\xa55,980 and for the current Android monthly charge, \\xc2\\xa55,980 and on top of that, the data packet communication of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sorry, the voice, domestic voice calls within three minutes up to 50 times per month is added on to, and if you add \\xc2\\xa51,000 on top of that, that is substantially free of charge for the voice. So going forward, it's not really the voice era, but it's going to be mainly the data communications era. And we have adjusted our way of pricing and launching new way of pricing for that. And so that whenever you call to other carrier \\xe2\\x80\\x93 other operators or call into the landline, whoever you call, this is going to be included into the cost of 1,000 times. So not only the SoftBank-own network but also provided to the other networks as well. So when it comes to the other countries, U.S. and some markets, already seeing such services available. And this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 however, we are the first one to launch this type of pricing plans in Japanese market. And also, the corporate market which I haven't touched to further in the presentation so far, and I would like to go into the details for this opportunity. As a matter of fact, the number of corporate customers for iPhone, we are number one. There are about still 110,000 companies that we're providing iPhone to those. After the Vodafone's K.K. acquisition, the market share of corporate customer was less than 10%. So, we are very much low in terms of corporate sales or corporate share. But now that we are aiming to, can we say number one, Mr. Miyauchi? Market share wise. It differs by the definition of market share but we could say we are number one in corporate sales. So I just confirmed with Mr. Miyauchi but we can say we are number one in corporate customers. You don't have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it seems like you're not very much confident about that, but I believe we can say that. But anyway, in smartphone at least, we are definitely number one in smartphone sales for the corporate customers. So, for the Japanese corporate sales, smartphone shares, we are overwhelming number one. If we include the conventional handsets [ph] IPP, (28:37) we are number one in terms of sales as well. And this is growing, still growing. And when it comes to iPad, we are also number one and over 100,000 companies that we are providing to. And this is an important part when it comes to Google Apps, so this is the Google application service for corporate customers. And we are global number one for the Google Apps for business cumulative numbers of IDs. So, we are the biggest seller of the Google apps for the global market. So, we are the biggest partner of Google from that sense And also, SoftBank has the biggest shares of the sales in iPhones, and if we include Sprint, we believe that it is the biggest customer of the Apple. And on top of that, when it comes to Google Apps, we are the biggest partner for the corporate sales in the Google Apps in SoftBank, and this is also continuously growing. So, not only selling iPhone, not only selling iPad to the corporate customers, but also we are selling on top of that, we are selling the applications. So as total solutions, we are providing such service to the corporate customers and providing various kinds of services. So we provide value to customers. We are not just offering products at the right price. Now, let me talk about O2O, and we believe that we are one of the first learners in terms of O2O Solution seller sales. Well, the customers or consumers look at advertisements on the website on PC or a smartphone, and then the customer can download e-coupon. And with that e-coupon downloaded on the smartphone, the consumers can go to physical stores to use coupon. We are used to have paper-based coupons or flyer-based coupons, but in our solution so-called Super O2O Solution, the consumers can use e-coupon. And our corporate customers can carry the advertisements on the website and we start \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from that website, customers can download a coupon onto their smartphones so that they can bring that e-coupon to the stores. So that way, our corporate customers could generate traffic to their stores, retail stores. And such corporate customers using that solution is rapidly increasing. And one example is this, this is the example of KAO, the consumer goods maker and they ran a campaign. And within two weeks, 70,000 consumers downloaded coupon. So, we can check the number of customers by checking the number of downloads. It's really hard to see how many customers visit the stores using the flyer-based work, paper-based coupon, but we can track the number of customers by looking at the downloads. So, with this solution, the companies can effectively draw customers to the retail stores at a lower cost. And this is another example, Aeon, a supermarket chain. Aeon is running large shopping malls in many places and the entire shopping mall utilized the Super O2O Solution to provide new shopping experience to the customers. So, we are increasing our presence in corporate customer market. We are selling Google Apps or Super O2O Solution. And from now on, we will increase our big data related business. So our business model is evolving, and we are not winning contract only by the price, but we are offering value-added solutions. And that's why, our income and profits are increasing. So we are not just a seller of lines, communication lines, but we are selling the lines combined with value-added services, or in other words, we are providing sophisticated service or solution as a package. That's why we are increasing profits. Now, let me talk about network. In the past, the people believed that SoftBank's network is not as good as other companies' network. So there are some group of people who wanted to switch to DOCOMO or au after those companies started selling iPhones. But actually, our call connectivity is better. About one year ago or July 2012, our call connectivity grade among three companies was we were ranked third. And even before 2012, our call connectivity was the worst among the three companies. But we beat our competitors after the summer of last year, and I wanted to announce that publicly, but our executive members tried to stop me announcing our result which is SoftBank's connectivity beats the connectivity rates of competitors. So not only the executive team members but also the working level person stopped me announcing that, so I waited another three months to announce that. But since we beat DOCOMO and au's connectivity rate, our connectivity rate has been improving. And this is about the smartphone call connectivity rate but about the call connectivity of feature phones, well, our feature phones are not equipped with antenna capable of platinum band spectrum. So, even so, we are building a platinum band base stations, the feature phone users cannot take advantage of that. So, feature phone users today would say that call connectivity of Softbank phones are not really good. But those consumers who bought smartphone for the past three years, they found that they have a better connectivity than competitors. So, our smartphone call connectivity is number one. And this is data connectivity rate. Since we beat our competitors in terms of data connectivity rates, we remained number one for the past year. Maybe some people are still skeptical, so let me show you the data. This is the data connectivity rates by landmarks across Japan, all across Japan. We surveyed the data connectivity every day at stations, train stations, university, shopping malls and so on. But we are not number one in ski resorts in terms of data connectivity, but the ski resort is the only place where we cannot be number one in terms of data connectivity rate. We beat KDDI but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so I don't want to criticize our competitors, but we are number one as this data shows. So except ski resorts, we are number one in terms of data connectivity. Even at the golf course, actually, we struggled to be number one in terms of data connectivity in golf course or beaches. We built base stations in mountainous areas or remote area, but although I don't \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we don't carry the graphs here, but we have collected data by prefecture. And at many places, we have improved the data connectivity to be number one. So because of that, our CapEx spending peaked in 2012 and 2013. So from now on, we would stop spending huge amount of CapEx. Out of CapEx spending, the tower construction cost is the highest but we seeing the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are almost finished the building of towers, so our CapEx spending will be going down to the moderate level. Let me remind you, we are not communications company but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 telecommunications company but we are Internet company. We have 1,300 company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 group companies and they are all in Internet business. And one prime example is Yahoo! JAPAN. Yahoo! Inc. in the United States has been struggling in making profit but Yahoo! JAPAN has been making profit since its foundation. So, there are some discussion going on that this growth has been stopped but since we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 having a fresher management there that we've been, again, accelerating the growth. And to make a full-fledged acceleration, we have decided to dig into the e-commerce business which we cannot avoid to have a full-fledged competition. Rakuten, Amazon, they are actually far ahead compared to us in terms of number of stores. And we'll never be able to exceed our number of products, number of stores that we'll not be able to exceed them. We have to have a lineup; otherwise, we cannot attract customers. Once we have products, then you will see the price varieties, diversifications of pricing and also the services and products. Number of stores, number of lineups, those needs to be exceed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 needs to exceed other competitors, then we'll be able to make a great competition there. So, that is why we decided to launch e-commerce revolution which is the end of last year. And as a result, as we can see here, at the end of December, number of stores applied exceeded 110,000. So never be able to achieve by both Rakuten or Yahoo! \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, Amazon in the past, however, we were able to bring that numbers to 3 times of more than Rakuten. That was the first time since its establishment of the business and Yahoo! became number one. As a result, the number of stores \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that was the number of application for the stores and we are in the process of opening those stores on Yahoo! JAPAN's Internet. And once that concludes, then that real transaction will happen. And we just started, and already start seeing some signs of increase in transaction volume growth ratio. In Yahoo! Shopping, we gained a 5% increase. And also, Yahoo! Auction increased by 10%. So now that we believe they are going to have very much momentum to grow further. In this service model or our business model that we are working very hard in Japanese market, but actually this advanced business model and also these sites, it's actually applied in China or the Alibaba. Alibaba already exceeded United States in terms of online shopping market or the transaction amount-wise that they have exceeded. And I believe that the gap is going to be wider even more. And the other day, November 1 which is the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 called as an \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, November 11 which is called as a Singles' Day which is Alibaba made \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's like a Black Monday for United States that Alibaba come up with this idea. And this is the day that many of the people enjoy the shopping and transactions. And that was a day that kind of made by Alibaba, 11/11, November 11, the Singles' Day in which one day of this day, the transaction amount happened in Taobao was \\xc2\\xa5160 billion. And when we compare with Black Monday, if we include all the Amazon and everything, but still Alibaba made 3 times of that amount in one day. So that's how that we can say that Alibaba is making quite a huge transaction volume. And the net income also outpaced the competitor. So net income already exceeded \\xc2\\xa5200 billion in nine months. So in nine months, \\xc2\\xa5200 billion. So if we annualized over a year, what happens? You can expect that with a simple math. So this net income compared to Amazon is tremendously large compared to our competitor and this is not one-time thing, but actually they are going to have this momentum going forward. So, this is how Amazon \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, Alibaba is positioned. And they are making evolutions like that. And also on top of that, we have application \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the most popular application in a smartphone, which is game. And those who are winner of game is the winner of the content I would say. And amongst such content, Puzzle & Dragons is making a very good popularity, and GungHo is making quite a good growth there. So, the third quarter results, the latest number was up until December. So, the previous period wise, net income was a little bit of slowdown, and there the people said that some growth had stopped. However, the latest figure wise in the December number was again revitalized. So, they are still making quite a good growth and the people recognize once again. And now that operating income was that it became 10 times year-on-year. And when we see the Google Play, amongst the application store on Google Play, they were ranking number one in the global market for 11 months, consecutively. And also, our other group company, Supercell, this is the global market of the Android. They are also hitting a global number one for 11 months straight. So Android, Supercell number one, and GungHo in Google Play number one for 11 months, so those two are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both of them are the SoftBank group companies. And Supercell recently launched their games in Google Play, the Clash of Clans is on the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 available in Android and that debut was made on October and right after debut, that are already coming to the top 10 ranking. And they became number four in November and number three in December. So they're making a steady ascent. Even on Android, I believe that the time of the becoming number one is very much soon, so it's going to be competing against Puzzle & Dragons so it's going to be the kind of battle of brothers. So that's how we see the situation, and when you go to the China, in application stores, we don't have much of the sales in application store in China. So I've been calling us as number one of global market, but those are all excluding China. So this is the first time that we're disclosing this information that the SoftBank has start seeding in Chinese companies, it's called Wandoujia. So the Wandoujia is seen as the seeding of ours in Chinese market right now, and we are trying to grow that. And we became the largest shareholder of this company. So the 15% of ours is already owned, and once that we execute the options, we will be achieving about 30% of ownership later on. So in China, as you know, Android is taking \\xe2\\x80\\x93 dominates the market, they taking about 88% and iOS is relatively smaller. And 88% of the Android market share then \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Google Android, as a matter of fact, is only 6%. Other than Google, those open-Android independent is taking about 73%, meaning that the Android in China is not really Google but this is regarded as an open Android. So, this open Android is used and application store is actually existing several on top of the Google \\xe2\\x80\\x93 open Android. And of course, Google Play on Android is taking shares. However, there are some other independent application providers are also playing in the market on top of the Android. They are about 73% in the market. And for the Android handsets, Wandoujia is taking \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or the penetration ratio is more than 50%, meaning that very important application store in Android in China is already been in our hands of SoftBank. So, how many people are we talking about? There are about 300 million users. Please look at the date here, so the company started in April 2012, so it's younger than two years old. But within two years, the user base has grown to 300 million. So, we can reach 300 million users to provide the SoftBank Group's content applications and so on. So, we sow seeds in China. We have 1,300 Internet companies in our group, so I can spend three days to talk about all 1,300 companies. But anyway, I'd like to talk about Sprint. Sprint announced earnings results yesterday. Their service revenue has been increasing. And since our acquisition of Sprint, the EBITDA margin made a turnaround. EBITDA margin used to be 14.9%, but right now it went up to 16.9% and adjusted EBITDA stood at $5.4 billion, up from $4.8 billion. That's our significant year-on-year growth. So what would happen in 2014? This is the forecast. The current forecast for adjusted EBITDA for 2014 is $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion, accelerating turnaround. After our acquisition of Vodafone Japan, the profit of mobile business increased by 9 times. And WILLCOM's business also turned around after our acquisition, and the same goes for eAccess. And same goes for Japan Telecom. Once we acquired Japan Telecom and renamed it Softbank Telecom, the telecom business turned around. So once we acquired company, we always turned around such companies. So, we would like to apply that formula to Sprint, so that Sprint will turn around successfully. So in 2014, actually, the Sprint announced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 publicly announced forecast of 2014, which is $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion. The Sprint management team, as a management of a public company announced the forecast for 2014, meaning that they are responsible for that number. But we really hope to accelerate the turnaround process of Sprint. But to make that happen, we need to satisfy customers, and to that end like SoftBank did, Sprint will spend heavily on CapEx to improve network significantly. As a result, the voice block rate should go down. Also customer would not experience their call drop in the middle of call. This is about the voice block rate, which is customer cannot connect call. And so Sprint has been spending heavily on the network, and as a result, the network is improving, so the voice block rate has been improving and improvement is happening in speed as well. The Network Vision \\xe2\\x80\\x93 under the Network Vision network, the speed improved \\xe2\\x80\\x93 speed gets faster by 13 times. And Brightstar's founder and CEO, Mr. Marcelo Claure, he's like a street fighter and he has strong determination. And he would join the Sprint's Board of Directors. We expect that by adding Mr. Marcelo Claure to the Sprint Board, we could generate the synergy effect between Brightstar and Sprint. We completed acquisition of Brightstar's share as of January 30, and SoftBank would eventually have 70% stake in Brightstar. Brightstar is a mobile handset distributor operating around the world. The company also distributes accessories to mobile devices. It also runs trading business as well. So, let me wrap up this presentation. So far, I talked about overall results of SoftBank Group and I talked about domestic business followed by Internet business and Sprint. Now I'd like to talk about forecast. For the fiscal year ending March2014, we would generate \\xc2\\xa56 trillion of net sales, \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion of EBITDA and \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of EBIT. And as we announced previously, we could achieve all this target. But this EBIT of \\xc2\\xa51 trillion includes one-time gains of \\xc2\\xa5250 billion, one-time gains from the consolidation of GungHo and WILLCOM. So in the next fiscal year, fiscal 2014, we are targeting to achieve \\xc2\\xa57 trillion of net sales, \\xc2\\xa52 trillion of EBITDA and \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of EBIT, and EBIT here \\xc2\\xa51 trillion doesn't include one-time gain. So, EBIT \\xc2\\xa51 trillion for fiscal 2013 includes one-time gain of \\xc2\\xa5250 billion, but our forecast for 2014, \\xc2\\xa51 trillion EBIT doesn't include one-time gain. So, let's say our EBIT for the full-year 2013 is \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, we should subtract \\xc2\\xa5250 billion and we would \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our forecast for 2014 is \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So, that means our EBIT should increase at least \\xc2\\xa5250 billion year-on-year by the end of 2014. So, please remember all these numbers 7-2-1: net sales, \\xc2\\xa57 trillion; EBITDA, \\xc2\\xa52 trillion; EBIT, \\xc2\\xa5 1 trillion. So please remember all these numbers: 7-2-1. So we're expecting to double the net sales from 2012, and EBIT, our forecast is \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, and EBITDA, we are aiming to double the EBITDA from 2012. Those are the forecast for 2014. It's been 20 years since our IPO, and for the past 20 years, our net sales increased 100 times, and operating income increased 300 times and net income increased 50 times. But that growth trend has not stopped yet. We are heading for doubling net sales and EBIT in two years. And we are placed 54th in terms of global EBITDA ranking. I'm talking about doubling net sales in two years. But how much we should increase EBIT to be global number one? Well, there's a long way to go. So considering that, just doubling EBIT is not enough. Maybe my ambition sounds arrogant, but we'd like to aim high and work hard until we become number one in the world. We are still number 54 in the world, so we should do more. About market cap, we are 81st, so we have a long way to go. So it looks like a long way, but actually it's not a long way, that's how I see it right now. So in summary, Japan domestic business keeps growing, so we will keep this trend. U.S. market, we will turn around and start making the growth. So, no excuse, aim for the increasing revenue and profit. So, that is all for my presentation. Thank you very much. \",\n",
       " '2013 Q4': \"Thank you very much for joining today. So recently, I think about the life. Life is wonderful, isn't it? It is really a wonderful thing, I believe. Life, sometimes there are a lot of challenges ahead. There are the ups and downs. However, if we do put every effort to go straight forward and keep the name and go towards to it, usually that's achievable. It's mysterious, but something achievable. And if you have such a passion and if you have a strong enough passion with you, as long as you keep that passion inside of yourself, although such a target is very difficult, but you'll come up with the wisdom and you'll come up with the encouragement, and also you have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you'll find a lot of friends and colleagues around you, and then I think that's something achievable. Right now, I am very much passionate. I am looking towards the next goal, next dream, always ahead. And I really hope that I will be able to achieve those. And I have very passionated with those target and goals in myself, so that I am very much determined to achieve that goal. So there are so many wisdoms now coming up to me. Of course, those wisdoms, not always easy to do or easy to execute. However, even though that there are the ups and downs, but still there would be another wisdoms will come up and then you'll be even more passionated. And that's why that I come up with this idea. Life is wonderful and you always have to have a dream. That's how I feel these days. Recently, there are lots of new dreams, which I'm going to share with you today, and I keep it into myself today, but however, there are lots of things that I'm really happy about, lots of things that makes me feel life is wonderful. And I am so excited having such a passion and which is very important, I believe. Now that I would like to go into my details of the earnings results overview. Here shows the number, 118 years. This is MCT. You see their logo. So MCT spans 118 years. And now, next Toyota, 65 years. And now SoftBank, here we go, 33 years. What do you think these numbers are? 118 years, 65 years and 33 years. These three companies with three numbers of years, these are the numbers to spend to achieve \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of EBIT. In Japan, only these three companies achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of EBIT or operating income. And now that we officially announce today that last fiscal year, we have achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of EBIT operating income. Those companies [indiscernible] (0:05:40) Mr. Honda or the Sony or Canon, there are so many wonderful companies were there. At the time of my childhood, they are so away and they are so top of tops. And those companies which established after the war actually didn't achieve the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in EBIT. In the long history of their company, they never achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in EBIT in the past. So far, the companies who achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in EBIT were only Toyota and MCT, only those two so far. And we, in these 33 years in Japanese economy, we actually achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of EBIT in the shortest period. And only three companies which has been able to achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in EBIT, and we are able to make it in the quickest way. Of course, Toyota has \\xe2\\x80\\x93 old days of Toyota founding company, including the founding company of Toyota, they spent more than 65 years. Substantially, this this Toyota Motors was born in their group company. So from their sales probably, they spend even more longer years. But SoftBank, we actually started from the scratch and spent 33 years to achieve \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in EBIT. And this number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we'll never satisfied with this number. Yes, of course. This number is only a stepping stone. And in the coming periods, we just look back and say that that was the only one day that we were so happy about achieving \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, but that's just the past. And we want to become even \\xe2\\x80\\x93 achieve even more. And honestly speaking, we do have the confidence in ourselves to be able to look back and say that was 30 years ago. At the time of acquisition of Vodafone, actually right after the acquisition, or the few days after the acquisition, there was event that we had a conference with the agents, the present agents of SoftBank Mobile and we said that within the 10 year, I said we're going to exceed DoCoMo for sure. And if we cannot do that, I will do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I will cut myself. I will do the harakiri as the president of the company. That's what I said in that conference. With those presence of the agents of the SoftBank Mobile. They were laughing as a matter of fact, what are you talking about, they're laughing at me. You just bought this company and this is very difficult and challenging industry. What do you know about that? That was the kind of situation. Of course, even the executives of the SoftBank or the management or even the employees, they never believed that we're going to exceed DoCoMo in ten years. That was like a dream, talking about dream. Because at that time, churn was really heavy. How can we avoid or reduce the churn? How can we gain more gross additions? That was even more important than exceeding DoCoMo back then. But myself, actually I did believe in myself that this is not just a dreaming story, but this is something that we got to do. So, we had very much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I had very much determined to exceed DoCoMo, and that needs to be explained in the figures, so numerical target. And that time SoftBank only becomes a profitable company at that moment, so that even we explained in the numbers, but still doesn't make much sense. But as far as we have a strong passion about that, that make us actually exceed them without waiting 10 years. Talking about the results, consolidated results of operations. Net sales, which recorded at \\xc2\\xa56.7 trillion, EBIT was over \\xc2\\xa51 trillion and net income was \\xc2\\xa5527 billion. Just net sales, it's doubled from a year earlier. This number includes Sprint segment figures. And EBITDA \\xc2\\xa51.8 trillion, which is 55% year-on-year increase, this also includes Sprint segment, light gray bar. But even without Sprint's EBITDA, we made an year-on-year increase of EBITDA. EBIT was \\xc2\\xa51.09 trillion. We hit \\xc2\\xa51 trillion mark. This includes one-time gain from making GungHo and WILLCOM subsidiaries. So, yes, this is inclusive of one-time gains. But whatever the reasons are, we are hit \\xc2\\xa51 trillion mark in EBIT. We are proud of that. And here, net income is was \\xc2\\xa5527 billion. It's a 42% year-on-year increase. So, we were determined to outpace DoCoMo within 10 years. And first of all, we are exceeded DoCoMo by net sales, followed by EBIT and then net income. We outpaced DoCoMo in three KPIs. It's easy to outpaced DoCoMo in just one KPI, but we exceed DoCoMo in net sales, EBIT, net income and the number of subscribers. On top of that we are better than DoCoMo in terms of network connectivity. All the research and results or data show that we are better than DoCoMo in terms of network connectivity. So we outpaced DoCoMo in all measures. And once we got ahead of DoCoMo, we like to grow the gap with DoCoMo so that they cannot catch up with us. That's what we are determined to do, and we deliver that. So far we spend six years to outpace DoCoMo. Six years ago, our net income was barely positive. And at that time, back in six years ago, it was hard to believe that we could outpace DoCoMo. But again, with a strong determination, and we kept that determination to outpace DoCoMo. We were not like a baby born in a wealthy family and without making hard efforts, the baby could grow up as \\xe2\\x80\\x93 grow up to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to join the established society. But actually we were not like such a lucky baby. We were not born \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are like a baby born in under-served family, but worked hard to grow up and to join, to make money. So the upbringing of NTT DoCoMo and ours is totally different because they are well funded from the beginning, but we were not. But we have strong passion and determination. Passion or determination are not on our balance sheet, so credit agency \\xe2\\x80\\x93 credit rating agency never see that determination or passion. But strong determination or passion makes the part of the corporate culture and we have a corporate culture, and with that culture we worked hard to outpace DoCoMo and eventually Toyota. Anyway, we had a strong determination to be number one and we worked very hard towards that goal. I don't want to name other companies in different industries, but we are not like a company that are settled for number two or number three place. We always want to be number one and work towards that goal. And this page summarized consolidated operating results, but all these are just figures. Of course, all these KPIs are important. Still numbers are just numbers, and here is cash flow summary and this is our dividend per share. We would like to focus on increasing enterprise value and enhance competitiveness. That will be our primary focus rather than increasing dividend. So we will \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are confident that we could increase enterprise value further. So we will deliver that. So, let me talk about domestic business. In the past, the people complained about connectivity, but when it comes to network, only two things are important. First of all, the spectrum. We need license to use spectrum. So as soon as we get license to use spectrum, we can resolve the spectrum issue. While we were at disadvantage in terms of spectrum, because our competitors had low band spectrum, but we were not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we didn't have low band, but we have a low band now. Another important thing is CapEx spending to build towers or base stations. So spectrum and CapEx, these are the two most important things about network. And with those two things we can provide a better network service. So once we addressed the two issues or two important things, spectrum and traffic, we were able to resolve the issues and we actually resolved the issues. And right now our mobile network is number one in the world in terms of connectivity and data speed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 effective data speed. We are probably number one in the world. We made inroads to the US market and, based on my experience in using US network, I become confident to say that network in Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mobile network in Japan is the best in the world when it comes to the connectivity and data speed. We can proudly say. But now that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about six months ago, we were not really confident about that. People say that SoftBank became number one in net addition because of iPhone. But actually, even before the launch of iPhone, we became number one in net additions. So we never make excuse when we are faced headwinds. We try to work hard to overcome all the difficulty. We are like baby born in not wealthy family but with effort we're able to become number one. So constant efforts lead us to this number one position. Here is mobile service revenue. We recorded 32% year-on-year increase and, as a result, here is mobile EBIT. And look at this little bar under the Vodafone operation mobile business, so the falling of mobile EBIT. But right now the mobile EBIT is over \\xc2\\xa5600 billion. So it's increased nine-fold. It's about eight times or nine times compared to that time. And network, network data traffic is increasing dramatically. And if I compare to six years ago, meaning right after the acquisition of Vodafone, our data traffic volume has become about 1000 times. And the average data traffic for our smartphone in Japan is about three times of US. So, that even compared with other countries, we are in the high data traffic. So this is something that I also like minister or MoC to understand that the Japanese data traffic is becoming a large scale compared to the other countries and also for the media people that I want you to recognize such a situation. Japan is now becoming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have to be provide \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have to pride ourselves that having such a big scale of the data traffic and you need to recognize that once again. In Japan, the mobile network, our connectivity rate of smartphone data is now number one in SoftBank. Of course, there are several customers who are not yet using smartphone. 900 megahertz platinum band, not capable with those spectrum handsets that are still there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 out there who are using such a handset compared to those that we are not yet exceeding DoCoMo and au. However, when it comes to smartphone, only relating to smartphone, our connectivity rate has exceeded au and DoCoMo. You can see that back in January last year that we were still behind, but everyday basis the delta between SoftBank and other \\xe2\\x80\\x93 those two, au and DoCoMo, that delta is becoming larger and larger. And this is a third-party survey and they are also backing such a fact. Under such circumstance, we have no serious network incident for more than 1,000 days. So we are the only company, amongst the other operators, that does not occur any serious network incident for more than 1,000 days. And this is a record. So that it's not only the partial things, but we are having \\xe2\\x80\\x93 well managing the network overall. So not only the partial network performance, but overall network management has been very good compared to the others. And why we have become number one. This is not any magic or anything like that. We recently received a license for the good connectivity spectrum, and we'll be working on building on such base stations with the highest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the highest speed of construction and made a dramatic deployment in the market about 18 months ago, or two years ago, compared to the July. That time that we have received the license for platinum band and we have with good a speed, good start to deploy the base stations for compatible with the platinum band. And at the same time, we have 2.5 gigahertz, 1.7 gigahertz and 2.1 gigahertz. With those three bands, we have deployed the base stations for LTE. It's a rocket start. And I believe that we are leading in this area and making a small cell deployment, big data or whole IP network. So in every angle we've been one of the leading edge of the network design and constructions and deployment. And we made CapEx ahead of the schedule and we peaked out now. As going forward, the building of the antenna has already completed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost completed and LTE equipment has almost completed. So that now going forward, the absolute figure for the CapEx we'll be able to reduce. So that from the management point of view is going to be positive. So up to here was the mobile or the telecommunications business. And from the time of acquisition, Vodafone, they've been saying that, even we entered a little bit late. However, we enter the market in last \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as the last operator. However, we are not thinking to become the mobile operation company. But we are still just being an Internet company and just the core or the center of the business is going to be a mobile for the internet area. And we are going to become the number one in such an industry. That was our target in entering into the mobile industry or mobile market. And when it comes to the core business, which is the Internet business in Japan, making record profit continuously and this new growth driver, e-commerce, becomes the further strength for Japan going forward. I think there are two things for e-commerce. One is the lineup of products, second is the price. So to have a variety of line-ups, you have to have more and more stores in variety and has to have rocket start with the numbers of stores and that is very important. So that is why that they have announced e-commerce revolution last year. As a result, they've been able to outpace Rakuten in terms of number of stores, almost twice as much. And they are already the stores which opened or they already finished the screening. So these are the numbers of stores after screening completed. So, going forward, they will be able to open up their stores, start the transaction with customers. We sign up products. One another thing is price. So I said one is line-up and second is price. Of course, once you have more and more numbers of stores, then the commission, we made it substantially \\xc2\\xa50, so that those stores that they will be able to make more profit. And once it becomes easier to make a profit, then they will be able to have more flexibility in terms of pricing and that will be returned to the consumers and buyers. So that our platform will have more and more stores and line-ups and also will have more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 better prices and trends. You may ask us if that is going to go down well that as a matter of fact. Transaction volume of shopping. It was a little bit flat these days. However, recently, that has been changed into the better position. YAHUOKU!, that is the auction, also doing the same way. And recently, that we have been seeing that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 once again an acceleration of the growth. Therefore, with the new management \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if the new growth strategy, e-commerce, which has already been implemented in China by Alibaba, and substantially it's the same business model as theirs. On top of that, Yahoo!'s new management led by Mr. Miyasaka, they have started Y! Mobile. That will be another key driver for the growth and they have effort to make such things happen, so that we have accepted. Y! Mobile, as soon as Y! Mobile announcement by Mr. Miyasaka, there are some rumors that Yahoo! was only the wallet for Softbank. Well, probably Softbank need more times, so that is why that Yahoo! was used to finance that money and asked Yahoo! to buy EMOBILE and WILLCOM and tried to get the money out from there. So there are such articles I've been seeing here and there and I heard about those from analysts and there are such questions coming up, I heard. And from Mr. Miyasaka, he was saying that maybe we shouldn't do it. So he was a little bit of complaining about such questions coming up so often. However, Mr. Miyasaka was just joking about it. He is very serious about making this Y! Mobile successful. And that would become very important new key driver for Yahoo! JAPAN going forward. And mobile is having more close relationship with content and service of Yahoo! JAPAN. He is trusting such a strategy and that is why he offered such a proposal to us and we answered to it. And I have asked his seriousness about that. And he said, yes, so that's why that we come to this conclusion. So I strongly believe that Yahoo! JAPAN will make further growth in its business. Now, earlier today, this morning, Japan time, 5 AM or maybe 6 AM today, Alibaba, its IPO process \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, Alibaba made an IPO filing in the United States and that was announced. So Alibaba's IPO process just has begun. Here is Alibaba's result. So they made a filing already, so I'm not in position to talk about anything other than what was announced by Alibaba today. So maybe some of you want to ask some questions, but I am not in position to answering any questions other than those already publicized. But look at this. Net income, which is the after tax income, in 2012, it was \\xc2\\xa589 billion, but in 2014 it was \\xc2\\xa5351 billion, four times year-on-year growth. That's substantial growth. Please look at this data from different angle. In the United States, there were two companies running Alibaba like business, one is eBay and the other is Amazon. Those two are major e-commerce operators in the United States. And their combined market cap is \\xc2\\xa521 trillion. And their combined net income has been flat for the past five years. But Alibaba's net income exceeded that of eBay, Amazon combined. Hence eBay and Amazon's net income had been fluctuated. But Alibaba's net income has been on the upward trend consistently. And here is transaction volume. So they also have an e-commerce platform and they also have variety of product. And how much transaction volumes have been generated? So this graph shows the transaction volume of eBay and Amazon combined. And compared to that, look at this, Alibaba's transaction volume. The Alibaba's transaction volume is far bigger than that's of eBay and Amazon combined. And the growth rate is also significant. Alibaba is running business only in China as of today. And eBay and Amazon are running business globally. But Alibaba generated that much transaction volume only in China. Net income, transaction volume, Alibaba exceeded that of eBay and Amazon combined and the growth rate is also increasing in both terms. And now, I'd like to talk about game. GungHo's app, number of downloads has been increasing. And Puzzle & Dragons is number one in App Store revenue ranking and Google Play revenue ranking. And it became number one in Hong Kong. GungHo's EBIT is this. Some people talked about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 said earlier that the GungHo business peaked. But actually GungHo recorded the highest revenue in the company's history in 2013 and expect to increase the revenue further, EBIT further. And this is the top growth in games on the Google Play Google ranking and Puzzle & Dragons have been number one for the past six months. But look at this, Clash of Clans. Clash of Clans is developed and marketed by Supercell, which is our group company. In the past six months, it grew to the number two in the global Google Play market. So number one and number two in the ranking were occupied by Softbank group companies. And Clash of Clans became number one in 144 countries and Hay Day became number one in 111 countries. So Supercell's two games became number one in that many countries. And another good news for us is this, Supercell launched its third game about one month ago that was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the title is Boom Beach and Boom Beach is steadily ascending the grossing games ranking and right now it's number one in 42 countries. So Supercell has three titles in top ten lists of popular game and the growth rate is really remarkable. And the two \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the three titles have been on number one place in many countries. And the recently launched title became number one in 42 countries as of today. So the Supercell's game became hit. But it's not just a one hit wonder. It has a strong potential. And about the smartphone or handsets accessories, we are trading in business of smartphone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 used smartphone. Brightstar is running the business of distribution of device accessories and trading in. And Brightstar and our group companies, Softbank CMS, combined, the net sales will be \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level. So they will become global number one distribution and services company in the mobile markets encompassing more than 100 countries in the world. So these companies are making a good progress in its business and contributing to the group level profit. Now, right now, another major focus is Sprint in the United States. The Softbank acquired a telecom \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Japan Telecom for the fixed line business and we acquired Vodafone's Japan's operation for mobile business, our mobile communications business, and also we acquired the WILLCOM which went bankrupt, but we acquired that company. And those three companies are turned around once they became \\xe2\\x80\\x93 came under the SoftBank's umbrella and they made a V shape recovery in their performance. And now, when it comes to Sprint, it's not really easy to turn around its business, but we see the good sign of turnaround. Let's look at the operating income being \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it had been recording net operating losses, but for the first time in many quarters, the quarter's operating income and, of course \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and so with that we expect the Sprint would record the annual operating income and this is consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin. And it had been on the declining trend, but it's been turning around and it started going up. With the Sprint management style and approach, we'd like to see the Sprint will improve its profits. I mentioned earlier that how did we do with the Vodafone Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how did we turn around Vodafone K.K. The network was weak. Brand was weak back then. There are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so many challenges were there and the SoftBank Mobile has been improved from that situation. And I mentioned that earlier about Sprint. Of course, not easy. And of course, competitors, it's one of the most profitable company in the world. Those two giants that we have to fight with those is not always easy, of course. We have to have a base \\xe2\\x80\\x93 customer base and the scale merit is necessary. Under such circumstance, somehow with the SoftBank way, with the so many ways or initiatives that we would like to make that happen. Starting from the low numbers, so that it doesn't \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it may not make sense, but the improvement is improvement. The EBITDA improved. And number one growth rate among four which you can tell. Of course, you have to grow the customer number. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense. So that why are we improving the network from the latter half of this year that we would like to make the turnaround. Before then, of course, we need to make efficient cost structures and also many things that we need to achieve, so that, for example, sales structures internally or the structure for the profit. And there are so many things that we are working on right now. But the network, once that they complete the network vision and initiatives executed, then that we believe we will be able to make a V-shaped recovery from here. Now that I'm going to the summary of my presentation, this is forecast. In previous earnings results, I mentioned \\xc2\\xa57 trillion, \\xc2\\xa52 trillion and \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, net sales, EBITDA and EBIT respectively. So this was the number that I announced that time. This \\xc2\\xa51 trillion is sales. In the footnote, saying that excluding one-time gains, so last year's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 last fiscal year's \\xc2\\xa51 trillion achieved because there was a one-time gain, like WILLCOM, GungHo, making those companies subsidiaries. There are the positive influence from there or the one-time gain about \\xc2\\xa5250 billion. But this time, \\xc2\\xa51 trillion of achievement will not include such one-time gain achieved, so that substantial ordinary EBIT wise it will be more than \\xc2\\xa5200 billion profit increase. And we've been managing that way to achieve such. And this time, we have our group include [indiscernible] (0:43:36) as a group company, so that this time we would like to make upward revision to \\xc2\\xa58 trillion from \\xc2\\xa57 trillion in terms of net sales for fiscal year 2014. And this is the budget or forecast, so that we cannot make detailed numbers. It doesn't really make sense. So we'd like to make it clear and simple, so that then also makes a clear digit here, so that the \\xc2\\xa58 trillion, \\xc2\\xa52 trillion and \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So now that we are counting in trillions, this was my target to count the company in trillion at the time of foundation of my company. And now that we're counting our company's number in trillion yen, and going forward, in the future, we would like to keep our efforts to make this number even bigger. So as SoftBank, in details of the number of earnings results, of course, that has a meaning. But in a big picture, even more importantly, five years later or ten years later or 20 years later, when it comes to the mid to long-term, how do we like to position ourselves in the business sense? And how are we going to develop our business in the long-term? Which is going to be even more important from my understanding? So as mentioned earlier, in the beginning of the presentation, I have a lot of dreams in myself. And every morning, when I woke up, I woke up with happiness. And I am so passionate and there are so many things in my mind. And one by one that we would have to execute. That's certain for me. Inside of such things, there are things may not go well. Sometimes we need to postpone and so on. However, there are such a feeling in myself and that's the big direction that we are heading towards. As long as we have heading such a direction, I believe that we will be able to achieve and be closer to the target and dreams. So we, SoftBank, will keep going and aiming high. Thank you very much. That is all for me. \",\n",
       " '2014 Q1': \"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am Son. So there are a lot of news going on and on. And I really feel that it's really exciting life that I've been going through. Every day, there are a lot of things happening and what is very happy about is that I am in a driving seat and I myself can make the direction within gas or with the brake or whatever it is. It's very interesting thing, exciting. And that's the time that I feel the joy of the life. So today, that I'd like to explain you our earnings results, but overall, it's going very well and very steady. And there are always a variety of options around and in my head, my brain is running all the time to look for every option available and keep thinking about those kind of things. So again, that I really think that it's very exciting to run the business. So now that I would like to go into the presentation, so first consolidated results of operations. Net sales, as you can see, is going very steady compared to the competitors wise. So far up until recent, we are always thinking how to catch up and exceed our competitors like NTT DOCOMO and KDDI. But here that we exceeded those two. And EBITDA, again, showing a very steady growth. And the comparison with competitors, once again, making a good jump compared to those competitors. EBIT is decreased by 16%. But if you look closely, last year I mentioned the same thing as of same day, the first quota of last year was high because we have temporary gains from consolidation of GungHo, and I repeated that several times since last year. Temporary gain's not happening every year, so if we exclude these temporary gains and look at the basic trend and if you're only looking at the growth of core business, actually, this give us a 35% increase. And looking at the comparison with competitors, we again exceeded competitors. And net income, on the accounting wise, it's 68% decrease. You may think that we are slowing down finally. But, as a matter of fact, once again, there was a temporary gains from consolidation of GungHo and others. And if we take that out, this is how you're going to see that. But still, you may say that this is a slowdown. But if you look at once again on the step forward, there are some IFRS adjustments happening here as you can see from the yellow bar and that Alibaba is now applying for the IPO and they are working on a process of that. And because of the IFRS adjustment, we have a temporary loss. It's recorded. Though it sounds like Alibaba is making negative, but that's not that. It's just the adjustment from IFRS and some time differences is happening here. So because of this time difference, some recorded as negative this time will going to be reversed adjustment once IPO happens by Alibaba. So this is just a matter of timing issue. So if we exclude that temporary gains and loss as a core business-wise, it was a 90% increase. So as a core business wise, it was very good result this time. And what is this loss came from, you may wonder, of Alibaba? So let me explain a little bit about it. Alibaba has a net income under U.S. GAAP, and for this first quarter, quarter for this time quarter, was positive of \\xc2\\xa533.60 billion, was also announced. And why this time is lost, it's because of the IFRS adjustment coming from the Alibaba's convertible preference shares or so-called CPS. This was issued for the financing purposes of the year before or two. And for the financing of the buyback of shares from Yahoo! that they have issued the convertible preference shares and the evaluation value of that has increased. Therefore, that has been regarded as liabilities. And this time, that we record it as a liability. Under the U.S. GAAP, this is not regarded as a liabilities increase, but under the IFRS, while it's very technical from the accounting purpose-wise, but it gave us the temporary loss from IFRS adjustment by \\xc2\\xa5103 billion. So, this net income plus this adjustment gives us the equity in loss of associates by \\xc2\\xa565.3 billion. However, this portion, \\xc2\\xa5103 billion of the same amount will be reversed IFRS adjustment at the time of IPO by Alibaba. So, exactly the same amount will be recorded later on. So, this is a matter of time difference. In addition to that, once Alibaba goes to public, there are some sales of share not by SoftBank but some of them will happen. So they will be recorded as deemed gain, unrealized gain after IPO. So that time that the temporary gain will occur at the time of the IPO by Alibaba and that IFRS is going to be gained from unrealized gain. So that's the only the technical discussion, technical matter. So from me, it's not really big things, but this is the adjustment that we're going to re-recorded at this time. So if we exclude that adjustment and only from the core business, there are 90% increase in our net income. So this is a short summary of consolidated operation results, now how about the net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA multiple. Please look at this page. It stood at 3.1 times which is manageable level. Right after Vodafone K.K. acquisition, it stood at 6.2 times. So right now, that multiple is manageable level, and we issued Fukuoka SoftBank HAWKS bond for retail investors. The total amount was \\xc2\\xa5300 billion and the coupon rate is 1.45%, which means that we utilized favorable conditions for financing. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we released this forecast. For this full year, our forecast for net sales is \\xc2\\xa58 trillion, EBITDA \\xc2\\xa52 trillion and EBIT, excluding one-time gains or temporary gains, will be \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So, please remember, \\xc2\\xa58 trillion, \\xc2\\xa52 trillion, \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. Those are the forecast numbers for this full-year, fiscal year 2014 and we are on track to achieve these forecast target. And let me talk about the SoftBank businesses. Domestic business first. Smartphone subscribers are increasing and it is expected to continue to grow. And with the growth of subscribers to smartphone, we can see a lot of business opportunities. For example, the SoftBank Mobile's EBIT is expected to grow further. The mobile EBIT kept falling under the Vodafone's operation but it's been growing since our acquisition. And under the Vodafone's operations, our mobile service offered poor connectivity and we had a hard time improving that but especially since after we launched the so-called platinum-band service, our connectivity has improved dramatically. And since then, our connectivity in both data and voice communication has been better than our competitors, as you can see on these graphs. Here is the third-party survey result. Under the mobile number portability system, the customers can switch plans. And after customers switched plans, are they satisfied with the new plans? And according to this third-party survey, those who switch to SoftBank says they are satisfied with the new service and the new carrier, and the SoftBank satisfaction level is much higher in terms of connectivity and speed. And this is another survey result, the call quality on moving Shinkansen or bullet trains, Tohoku Shinkansen, Tokaido Shinkansen and Sanyo Shinkansen. And carrying three operator smartphones we tested call qualities onboard the Shinkansen train. In the past, the SoftBank's mobile phone experienced a call drop or call lag onboard the Shinkansen train, but according to the latest survey, the SoftBank's smartphones enjoy a better connectivity and call quality onboard Shinkansen train. Before, we didn't have the low-band frequency license, but once we obtained that, platinum-band service started and we became number one in terms of call quality in Japan. And here at Yahoo! Japan, after they reshuffled the management team, they have been growing their business and income. And here is the number of stores on the Yahoo! shopping mall. The Yahoo! has been competing with Rakuten and Yahoo! has been behind in terms of e-commerce, but Yahoo! Japan announced e-commerce revolution last year and since then, number of stores in Yahoo! shopping mall has increased significantly. The total number of stores, including those who passed the screening, leaped 130,000, which is by far the largest number of stores in Japan. And this graph shows number of available items on the shopping mall. The page area shows number of stores and merchants. That includes stores who finished the screening process but haven't opened store yet. But those who have opened stores offered more than 100 million items in total, and we expect the number of items available on Yahoo! shopping mall will further increase. Next topic is about Pepper. Japan's robotic industry is expected to grow significantly, in my view. And thus, we announced the world's first personal robot that reads emotions. This is offered at affordable price for household use. All the information is stored in cloud AI, a cloud system, and utilizing AI, the robot can learn from interaction with people. And we deployed Peppers in our stores and it works to increase the number of visitors. And like the smartphone application or tablet applications, this robot application is open for development by third parties or any kind of developers. So, we are going to hold developers' event next month, 20th of September to be exact. So, Japan's business has been producing good results and we'd like to replicate this success in other part of the world. So, let me talk about Sprint. The Sprint performance has been turning around and network improvement has made significant progress. Please look at consolidated adjusted EBITDA first. EBITDA increased 30% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. And for two consecutive quarters, it recorded positive income. Before our acquisition, the company recorded operating losses but for the first time in quarters, it started recording positive operating income. About network, the progress has been seen in network improvement. Please look at this, call accessibility rate. This means if call can be connected or not, and as you can see, accessibility rate has been improved significantly and this page shows LTE accessibility rates significantly improved. Well, the Sprint connectivity was poor, people said in the past and especially data connectivity was poor in the past. Please look at gray highlighted area. This represent competitors' connectivity, the three competitors' connectivity in range. As you can see, the Sprint line is far below the range of competitors' connectivity, but the trend [indiscernible] (20:28) from April 20, and as of today, the Sprint connectivity rates is catching up almost comparable level with data connectivity. And this page shows data connectivity in national carriers. And this page shows LTE or data connectivity in 4G areas. Competitors' LTE network has advanced. And again, April 20 that they've made a great improvement since then and now catching up with the competitors. So improvement of the network has been progressed very well. And also, proceeding the cost reduction or cost efficiencies. But the one thing that I am not satisfied with is the acquisition of customers is not going yet. That's the fact. And there are some expression on media saying that the Sprint is losing. But the fact is that we are losing customers but that's something we knew that that part through the middle 2014 that we need to wait until the completion of network. And although we wanted to aggressively acquire the customer, but if a network is not ready, then it doesn't really make sense. So, that we couldn't have aggressive sales pitch. But now, I'm so happy that I'll be able to say that we've been able to make a good improvement in network. So, here and on, we now be able to have aggressive acquisition. And for the structure, board has appointed our new CEO, Mr. Marcelo Claure, is now assuming the President and CEO position of Sprint Corporation. And now having a new CEO to lead the sales aggressive company, as a result, the Sprint strategy going forward is going to focus on customer acquisition through network improvement and, at the same time, have a further cost reduction. So, these two will be the highlight for the basic strategy of Sprint. And Marcelo, as a founder and CEO of Brightstar and been providing distribution of mobile devices and also managing the dealers of those devices so that he has a good understanding of the U.S. market, as well as global market of mobile devices. And also he has a strong talent and skill set in terms of sales and acquisition. And along with that, we have decided to have additional purchase of Brightstar Global Group shares and now became the 100% subsidiary. Up to this page was the Sprint overview. And now that we also like to touch on the game industry, here in GungHo and Supercell. Why we are focusing on game is because mobile game revenue or the mobile game area itself is growing, and now that the revenue is going to be three times in five years. And smartphone games or mobile device games, GungHo is making a tremendous growth. Number one in Japan, but also developing their footprint to global market right now and expanding its area. Also when you look at the global market, Supercell is already getting number one in several countries such as Clash of Clans, Hay Day and Boom Beach, and they are making a steady growth here, too. And this is the ranking of top-grossing games, and you see the top five of those. GungHo, Puzzle & Dragons is ranked in number 2 after combining iOS and Google Play, and the Puzzle & Dragons by GungHo is now number two. And number one and number four is from Supercell, which is also our group company. So amongst the top five, three of the titles are coming out from SoftBank Group. So five out of five \\xe2\\x80\\x93 top five ranking, that the three of them are from SoftBank Group. So once again, we believe that this area is making a steady growth, too. And one another group companies in overseas is Alibaba. Alibaba is now applying for listing on New York Stock Exchange and they are working on that process. As I mentioned earlier a little bit in the beginning of my presentation, in last year whole year, recorded \\xc2\\xa5375 billion of net income after tax. Compare that with one year before, it has grown by three times or a little bit of this. So this is making quite a good growth and making a steady progress. And I believe that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I'm also confident that their application for listing on New York Stock Exchange will be smoothly held. And the SoftBank business domains, up until last year, most of the focus was on domestic business but now that the SoftBank is also looking at overseas and expand its business domains all over the world. And for the global, or business-wise, we have also appointed as the Vice Chairman of SoftBank Corp., and who used to be a former Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer of Google, Mr. Nikesh Arora, assumed the Vice Chairman of SoftBank Corp. So in a business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he was the Chief Business Officer of Google Inc. and Mr. Nikesh Arora assumed the position of Vice Chairman of SoftBank Corp. He was the number two in Google, which is one of the largest Internet companies, so he has well-known about Internet industry but before then, he was also involved in the mobile business of Deutsche Telekom, so he has communication knowledge and Internet knowledge, so he has both knowledge and skill set which is very rare personnel in the world. SoftBank also look after both communication and Internet, so from that sense, I think this person has a very well knowledge about both areas and we are very happy to have him for the further development of the global market and he'll be a great support to our business going forward. And fiscal year 2014 consolidated operation results forecast, as mentioned earlier, net sales, EBITDA and EBIT, we are on track, and the way we'd like to go with this trend and towards the further growth that we would like to make a good step. That is all for my presentation. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " '2014 Q2': \"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. So first off, I would like to discuss this thing. SoftBank is goose. So why SoftBank equals to goose? For that explanation, let me do that during the presentation. So SoftBank equals to goose. Please, first of all, I want you to remember this page and this slide and the reason I would like to explain it to you later. So highlights. Net sales over \\xc2\\xa54 trillion, net income up 37% year-on-year. Consolidated results of operations. Net sales we can see in this graph. And compared with the competitors, we have a big achievements compared to the competitors like DOCOMOs and KDDI. Actually, in European countries and United States, EBITDA is mainly focused rather than net sales. And you see that this period we have exceeded \\xc2\\xa51.1 trillion. This is the first time in the record for company. And EBITDA, if you compare with the competitors once again, we have much bigger EBITDA compared to the competitors as we can tell from this graph. EBIT or operating income. Last year, as I mentioned in that meeting, there was a one-time gain or temporary gain from consolidation of GungHo and WILLCOM. So making those companies as subsidiary that we have a temporary gain here in the previous periods. But that was only the one-time. So if we exclude those one-time part, if you just compare apple-to-apple and the normal EBIT or operating income, we have made a 22% increase. And EBIT comparison with competitors, once again, we are exceeding those two. And net income, 37% increase. And this is the summary for the consolidated operational results. And why SoftBank equals to goose? This is the introduction of explaining why that is. And this is the market cap of SoftBank. It's about \\xc2\\xa510 trillion. And portfolios that SoftBank owns like Alibaba, Yahoo!, GungHo, if we add those, that is almost equals to the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or even larger than the market cap of SoftBank itself. So the SoftBank market cap consists of only Alibaba, and Yahoo!, GungHo. So what is the remaining. The normal operating income or normal operations that generate operating income, those what we count from the view of market cap of SoftBank whether \\xe2\\x80\\x93 those goals, that will be put it on to this graph, then you can see like this. We have a mobile operation by acquiring former Vodafone K.K. and we have high profitable company compared to the other operators in the world, so that those actually that our mobile operations and Sprint is coming in. And the Sprint actually in size of about \\xc2\\xa52 trillion and that's also comes along free. And for SoftBank, recently the visible gain that you'd be seeing is as you all know, Alibaba when listed in New York Stock Exchange, and we had a quite a good relationship. And Alibaba now became top 10 in terms of market cap amongst all industry in the world. About 10-some years ago, the company just founded and at that time the SoftBank decided to make an investment. It's about 14 years ago, and the employees was only about 30-some people there and their revenue was almost zero. And that company, only 10 years or 10 and some years later that they became in the number 10 in market cap. How many of you could imagine that? In the IT industry, Alibaba became number 4 in terms of market cap. And last year, in Japanese yen, \\xc2\\xa525 trillion gross merchandise volume was made. And recently, as of today as a matter, there was earnings call also held and the year-on-year base almost close to 50% increased in GMV. And revenue, net income, both are making a rapid growth here too. And e-commerce market in China is actually growing and we are expecting that it will become \\xc2\\xa5100 trillion level of the e-market and about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of which 80% Alibaba. And if we count that, that's going to be a big potential. And Alibaba actually ramping towards further growth. And next is Yahoo! Japan. Yahoo! Japan is making steady net income growth. And here, it's now operating like Alibaba's model, so charging commissions or fees from merchandise, but they stopped that and tried to gather more margins and become small platform like Alibaba business model so that they have changed, transformed their business model. In only one year, the number of stores became 10 times in a year. And the number of available products also increased by 50% so that e-commerce in Yahoo! Japan is going to be even bigger going forward from my understanding. And coming back to the domestic telecommunications business, which regarded as a core business of SoftBank Corp. or SoftBank Group, and let me explain to you the detail of SoftBank Mobile. Right after we acquired the former Vodafone K.K., mobile EBIT was actually decreasing steeply. But, right after the acquisition, that made increase to 9 times growth. And as I mentioned earlier, ownership of interest is almost close to the market cap of SoftBank itself so that mobile should be seen as a certain level of value there. And for the first half, \\xc2\\xa5401 billion operating income was generated only in the mobile. Now, let's look at the smartphone connectivity. Connectivity rate has been improving constantly. And also, compared to competitors, the SoftBank's connectivity level has been better than that of competitors. So it's not just one-time luck. The SoftBank Mobile's data connectivity and co-connectivities are better than competitors. And this page shows data communication speed. Now, all three carriers are offering the same model of iPhone, so it's easy to compare with each other. So the speed wise, we are number one. And according to the third-party survey, the iPhone 6 data communication speeds were number one. And also customer satisfaction survey also prove that our service level is better than others Nikkei personal computers' survey never ranked us number one before, but for the first time in history, we were ranked number one. So we were overjoyed, because we thought that Nikkei personal computing survey will never rank us number one. So that was because our connectivity has been improving, and customers and consumers recognize that. So we are number one in connectivity, and we are number one in communication speed. And for the past three years, we spent heavily on CapEx to increase the number of base stations and also to address the deployments of Platinum Band, but the CapEx peaked in 2013. Now that we are exceeding competitors in terms of connectivity and speed, so EBITDA is income from our operations. And EBITDA minus CapEx equals to free cash flow from the business. Of course, we need to deduct tax from that amount. But anyway, we will be constantly generating hundreds of billions of free cash flow now that we passed the peak of CapEx spending. So the Softbank's domestic mobile communication business will continue to generate free cash flow. So, the Softbank's domestic telecommunication business finally meets the stage where it will constantly generate free cash flow. So next is Sprint. Since our acquisition of Sprint, the company experienced loss of customers. The company recorded net loss of customers. However, with new CEO, the trend started to be reversed. This page shows the Sprint platform postpaid net porting trends, and it had been losing customers to other carriers, but these days, Sprint is gaining customers from other carriers. So the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sprint has been suffering from the loss of users. And they are dealing with two types of customers: sub-prime customers with low credit rate and because they needed to increase number of customers, they acquired sub-prime customers in the past, but with a new CEO were appointed, the company started to increase the mix of prime customers. Sprint tightened the screening, credit screening of customers. So they try not to acquire so many sub-prime customers. Instead, they try to acquire prime customers more than before. So we believe that the Sprint performance will be turning around in the mid long-term perspective. So, so far, the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sprint tried to increase the number of customers without considering the loss from sub-prime customers. Well, when you acquire customer, you have to pay up front. For the short-term profits, the Sprint tried to acquire sub-prime customers. That's what they did before the new CEO was installed, but they changed that strategy. They tried to increase the prime customers even so that would weigh down the profit in the short run. But in the long run, acquiring more prime customer is better. So once that Sprint \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was acquired by Sprint, the EBITDA turned around and recording positive EBITDA, but the rates of improvement is not so large. But instead of trying to achieve the rapid growth of EBITDA, they tried to acquire the prime customer for the long term profit. So because of Sprint for the smaller EBITDA, we changed the operation result forecast for fiscal year 2014. So since the Sprint is consolidated subsidiary, our EBIT forecast for this fiscal year was divide down to \\xc2\\xa5900 billion because of the Sprint's division of their EBITDA forecast. But other than Sprint, all the companies in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most of the companies are EBIT and EBITDA are on track to achieve the target we set at the beginning of this year. Now let me remind you, 14 years ago on January 1, 2000, I send a message to all employees saying, winners in China will take the world. And around that time, we started investment in Alibaba. Why did I think so? Back then in 2000, Japanese business leaders or journalists had doubts about the growth of China. So when I publicized this comment, a lot of people expressed doubts about my viewpoint. But actually, China's GDP outpaced that of Japan. Japan is now ranked number three in terms of GDP in the world. Right now, the China's GDP is about 2 times as large as that of Japan. Only a few years ago, Japan was outpaced by China. As of today, the China's GDP is nearly double the size of Japan. And 35 years later from now, the China's GDP will be more than doubled that of U.S., in one estimate. In my view, the decision making should be based on the long-term viewpoint, not the short-term forecast or short-term viewpoint. 10-year time period, 20-year time period or even 30-year-period forecast should be based on my decision. That's my style of decision making. Now, from now on, we'd like to focus on India. Why? 35 years from now, the world's top two economies will be China and India, and their size of GDP will be by far larger than that of U.S. In 35 years' time, as you can see in this graph, India will outpace United States sometime in mid 2030s, so maybe 15 years later from now or maybe 20 years from now. So in the mid to long-term period, about 14 years ago, I said China is coming. And now that I will say India is coming. And the background for that, why I say that is because those population under 25 years old, they are taking about 50% in India. So there are young generations, young populations taking 50% of the country. And also, it's an English-speaking country. As of today, population who speaks English, there are 130 million. But they have 1.3 billion population. And also, education is almost taken in English. So this number can exceed United States and they can be the world's largest English-speaking country. That's how I see. And also, on top of that, the number of software developers, as of today, it's already the world largest IT nation, which means three important factors: young generations, English speakers, and number of software developers. So those three factors, key factors, is actually stronger \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or those could be stronger than the fundamentals of China. So that is why this 21st century China and India will be developed as the two biggest economies in the world. In that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so what I see Alibaba, maybe people can say that we are just lucky. SoftBank was just lucky enough to encounter the great company, and you may say that and many people will say that. But then, when we made investment in Alibaba, and not until it comes to the IPO, nobody really care about Alibaba or nobody cared that the SoftBank holds shares of Alibaba and nobody really counted that Alibaba, but that actually became visible recently because of IPO. And now, what we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because I just said that India will become those \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the two biggest economy in the world, then I believe this company which is Snapdeal, can be the next Alibaba. Of course, if you look back 10 years ago when we made the investment in Alibaba, \\xc2\\xa52 billion investment and it became 4,000 times. And if I said that, people will say, why you didn't tell me back then? You could tell me. But, of course, back then, even I told but it was under \\xe2\\x80\\x93 before IPO also you were not able to make an investment there. But when India, Snapdeal, this is also before listing so that the general public cannot make an investment in that company, private company of Snapdeal, but Snapdeal, which is a listed company, holds this Snapdeal and we'll \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with that, we believe that the e-commerce market in India has been in growth by seven times. If you can become the shareholder of SoftBank that you can do that because we are a listed company, you may not be able to invest in Snapdeal, this is a private company. But by becoming shareholders of SoftBank that you'll be able to also have indirectly the Snapdeal. And this company only in the 18 months, how much growth that made? You can see this. As you saw, how many times growth has been made, only 18 months, and this much of growth has been made by this company. It's making a rapid growth. And next \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the Snapdeal, I'd say, that that can be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I believe that the can be next Alibaba, but there is another company called Olacabs. This company provides the platform for cab booking in India, and we became the major shareholders of this company last week. This company does not hold any of the car, does not hold any driver, but already have 33,000 registered cabs. And this over 33,000 cabs is charging about 5% to 10% of their revenue. So that's how they run the business model and making also a rapid growth here. And as you can see, they have made about nine times in 10 months, so 900% increase. So there are a kind of a gold rush happening there right now. And Ola taking about 60% of market share in cab booking service in India. And next one is Indonesia. E-commerce in Indonesia is also making quite a rapid growth and biggest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the biggest online marketplace in Indonesia, we, SoftBank, became the major shareholder. Also making a rapid growth in couple of years, as we can see from this graph. So India, Indonesia, China, those are the companies that we are aiming to become even robust position in terms of platform in Asian countries. And you may say that Alibaba was lucky for SoftBank, but how about other than Alibaba, what is the track record of SoftBank so far and I would like to kind of give you some background. Alibaba actually made 80% of IRR. In the beginning, we made \\xc2\\xa52 billion as an investment and taking about 35% of the ownership. And later on, we have added about \\xc2\\xa510 billion or so to increase the ownership of 0.1% to 0.5% so that in total, that this is the total amount, cumulative amount that we have invested in this company. And that made IPO so that \\xc2\\xa59,252 billion of the accumulated return so that annually making 80% of a return. And when you look at Yahoo! Japan, also, again, that making about 78%, almost close to 80% of IRR others also, there are several companies portfolios of exceeding 50% of IRR. And next page, those Internet companies more than \\xc2\\xa510 billion, some of them you see that the red highlight, those are the failures. So you see that venture capitals, if you invest \\xc2\\xa51,000 and if you can't get the homerun of three, then that's good enough. That's the kind of ratio that people say. But in our case, in the Internet investment in more than \\xc2\\xa510 billion, we have less numbers of failures compared to the successful case so that this kind of investment usually people say high risk and high return. That's the kind of general consensus. But our track record of SoftBank actually is not that high risk as a matter of fact. Rather, we're making the investment in \\xc2\\xa510 billion, I myself hands-on and made the decision, actually we made better rate. So this is the page \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these are the main \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and these are the number of larger volumes. In the next slide, these are some red highlighted. But when you see in total, in the past 10 years, this is the cumulative investment amount, \\xc2\\xa5387 billion. For \\xc2\\xa5380 billion, how much that became? Actually, \\xc2\\xa511.7 trillion. So only \\xc2\\xa5380 billion investment has made \\xc2\\xa511.6 trillion. So it's about 30 times. So IRR-wise, it's 45%. So if you deposit money in bank or if you invest them in equity, if you'd keep invest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you'll be able to get the return of 45% every year? Have you seen such a venture capital? Not only the one year, but in the past 10 years, continuously in that average IRR 45% and not a small amount as a matter of fact. As a result, \\xc2\\xa511 trillion return has been made, which I believe there's no such better capital and the SoftBank could be the overwhelming number one compared to those. We didn't manage someone else's funds like venture capitals do. We invested our own money into all these companies so the return, the whole amount of return belongs to SoftBank's shareholders. SoftBank's market cap is \\xc2\\xa510 trillion right now. So, almost all the amount of SoftBank's market cap is equal to the return on our investment and SoftBank made investments in mainly Internet companies. And as a result, the investments generated a return of \\xc2\\xa511.7 trillion and SoftBank's employees are working hard every day. So we see values in them and SoftBank's dealers and other partners. We see values in them. So I'm talking about investments, so maybe you're having questions that what is our core business? Is that an investment company? No. Our core business is Internet company. We started as a software distributor, but as time changed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 time changes, we are invested in that Internet business, but in the course of time, we realized that the speed of Internet in Japan is slow. So, we decided to change the situation by investing in infrastructure. Back then when we started in Internet business, the DOCOMO owned more than 70% of the infrastructure of Internet in Japan, but we wanted to change the Internet environment in Japan. So, we started to launch ADSL service on our own, and then I met the late Steven Jobs, and at that time, I told him that the device like iPhones will be the center of the Internet age. And that's why we started selling iPhone and also we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 during that time, we kept investing in Internet business and Internet companies. So we're pursuing the telecommunications business, but at the same time, in parallel with that, we constantly invested in Internet businesses. Now, as we announced the other day, as the Vice Chairman of SoftBank, the former Google Officer, Mr. Nikesh Arora, joined SoftBank. He's here in this hall. He serves as Vice Chairman of SoftBank. He and me spent time together to discuss the strategy of SoftBank. On top of that, we will be joined by the former Senior Managing Director and partner of Fortress Investment. Actually, I got to know him when he worked for Deutsche Bank. And Deutsche Bank helped SoftBank when SoftBank was in hardship financially. So Mr. Rajeev Misra joined SoftBank as a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to optimize financial strategy of SoftBank. So again, the SoftBank is an Internet company. SoftBank had always been aiming to be the Internet company of the world. Now, in that context, I'd like to show you one of the Aesop's fables. This is a story about the goose that laid the golden eggs. A farmer owns a goose and that goose lay a golden egg every day, just one egg every day and that farmer sold the egg at the market to gain income. And that process repeated every day and that goose lays golden egg, just one egg every day, but that golden egg makes him richer. So he became greedy and he once started to believe that if he looked into the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if he killed the goose, then he can get more eggs at one time, but actually, there's no egg inside the goose. And he killed the goose and the goose never laid eggs because it was killed. So the goose never produced any golden egg from that point on. So, I have a question for you. Yes, golden eggs are valuable and goose itself is not the gold, but which is more important? Once you sell a golden egg. That's it. You can gain income, but just \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's just one-time gain. Now, goose itself is not the golden egg, but as long as you keep the goose, that goose will produce another golden egg and on and on. So, in that sense, which is more valuable? In my view, a goose that can lay golden eggs have more value than golden egg itself. So, please remember what I told you earlier in today's presentation. SoftBank is a goose and SoftBank wants to be a goose that can lay golden eggs. So I repeat that SoftBank wants to be like a goose that lays golden eggs. So, please associate me with goose. Now, let me refresh your memory. This graph. This is some of the past analysis of SoftBank's value. So every asset SoftBank has are the goose that can lay golden eggs. Analysts and journalists evaluate our company's value and when they do that, they use some of the parts analysis method. They count the golden eggs of the company and count up and then evaluate the company's value. Now, the SoftBank's value today was SoftBank's market cap today is smaller than the actual value of SoftBank has. Of course, we need to think about debt we have. But anyway, right now the SoftBank market cap is what those things that analysts can see. But we need to think about the potential of our \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all these assets. And also we are keeping investing as new companies. So we need to add the value of such new Internet group companies. And also, again, we are goose. Softbank is a goose and SoftBank is carrying eggs. But it hasn't laid eggs. But it carries egg inside. So maybe the eggs inside the goose can be this highlighted area. But like I said, what is more valuable than golden eggs are the goose itself because goose can lay golden eggs. So why the SoftBank's market cap is smaller than the actual value of SoftBank, because the market believe that maybe the SoftBank will go on shopping spree with his crazy idea. He will borrow a huge amount of money again, and with that debt, the company's value will be destroyed. That's what market people believe, so that's how the market discounts our value. Okay, we don't have a sufficient track record to prove that idea is not true. Well, just for passing, the Berkshire Hathaway market value is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the value plus Buffett premium because Mr. Buffett is believed to be the God in investment world, so his \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire Hathaway's value is the company's portfolio value plus so called Buffett value or Buffett premium. So, but in the case of SoftBank, the corporate value or market enterprise value is a discounted value because of the negative premium of Mr. Son or Masa Son, but maybe, what people believe as negative premium of Masa Son is Masa's premium. So what is our \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the value discounted today could turn into the premium to be attached to the market value of SoftBank. So when we talk about money, well, actually, I don't want to talk about money very often in public. But our concept, though, our philosophy is that we create the information revolutions. And that is our vision, that is our philosophy, and we want to make people happy and provide happiness for everyone through the information revolution, not only by ourselves, but together with those who share our vision, together with those who share our philosophy that we would like to create information revolution. We cannot do it by ourselves alone. And we cannot do that overnight. We have to do is the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 people who share the vision and philosophy such as Alibaba, Snapdeal, Yahoo! Japan, Supercell, GungHo. There are so many companies, those not always 100% wholly-owned subsidiary. But even that, if we have a company with 30% ownership, that can be 300. It doesn't have to be the 100% subsidiary. So, that's how I think about the subsidiaries and group companies so that we would like to have kind of people and the friends who share our philosophy and create information revolution for the people's happiness. And that's how we would like to aim and also run our business, not only to create and earn the money but through the information revolution. At the same time, we would like to make and provide the value to the shareholders. Do not reduce the golden eggs but actually increase the number of golden eggs, increase the value so that we would like to also get an understanding from the shareholders. And we would like to proceed further, information revolution. That is all for my presentation. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " '2014 Q3': \"I am Son from SoftBank. I'm a little bit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 caught a cold, and therefore I may cough time to time. And I'm also told that I shouldn't be speak too much because of my throat, sore throat. So excuse my voice today. So now that I would like to go into my presentation. Consolidated results of operations, net sales up 41% year-on-year. And the EBITDA is 22% increased. EBIT down 16% and this is because in the last year, we had a temporary gain from consolidation of GungHo and others. So consider excluding these temporary gains, you can see the real strength of our business EBIT in the result that we have a 14% increase excluding such temporary gains. And the net income, up 16%, you can see the details in the summary. In the last announcement, we made fiscal year forecast. So \\xc2\\xa58 trillion, \\xc2\\xa52 trillion, and \\xc2\\xa5900 billion respectively and we maintained this forecast as we announced in the previous announcement which means in our business, as announced, that we are on track as forecasted. And let me go into some details on our business. We have two business domains in SoftBank. One is Communication, the other is Internet. So there are several services in here. First of all, I would like to touch on Communications side. After the acquisition of Vodafone K.K., nine years have passed and in these nine years mobile EBIT has been \\xe2\\x80\\x93 became 10 times. As I repeated, at the time of acquisition of Vodafone K.K. I've been often asked why now, why I was acquiring such mobile business because there are some [ph] anxious about (4:35) the business growth itself. But actually it made a smooth growth and now that we're seeing 10 times EBITDA (sic) [EBIT] (4:42) since then. Network in the beginning, right after the acquisition, there were few base stations up. And since then we also increased these base stations by 10 times, and now we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we don't hear anymore that the SoftBank phone doesn't have a connectivity. So as you can see from the several surveys and the research, but that also shows that the connectivity of our smartphone has exceeding the others steadily. And from the third-party survey, there are results of speed tests, we've been able to reach number one in terms of smartphone data communication speed. So the CapEx, I would say, we finished one cycle, so that going forward I believe CapEx free cash flow we will be able to a little bit ease on that. And for the corporate customers, we've been providing a very advanced smartphone use or the smart pad use in proposing such products and services. And those are many cases there. So the latest case is that we have offered and provided 22,000 iPads to Mizuho group. So we've been having successful offers and transactions. And with that we've been seeing several work style revolution. I had a chance to meet the top executive of Mizuho, and he was very happy about introducing such work style, and he was very pleased with the result. And I believe that this case is actually increasing in the market. And when it comes to SoftBank, people would say that the only iPhone that we are focusing on, but actually, we're also putting a focus on Android. And actually, the unit sold has been increased by 63% so that the SoftBank plus Ymobile, which is the subsidiary of SoftBank, results the sum of those numbers. We have increased by 63%, especially Ymobile is showing a very good result in terms of newly sold Android units, exceeding Docomo and KDDI and now that reaching number one for new acquisitions. So under the SoftBank Group, we've been able to increase more customer base, taking an advantage of the collaboration with business synergies with Ymobile. And also wireline and the optical fibers and mobile, so having bundle service of those is also starting from this month. We call this smartphone and Internet bundle discount so that this is the bundled service for wireline and wireless. And student discount, actually this service is developed by SoftBank when it comes to Japanese market so that we are very much aggressive on student discount for the mobile customers. Actually, it was a relatively rare service looking at the other markets in the world. And we've been putting continuous focus on this student discount too, not only the sales side, but also these days, we've been also paying attention to the artificial intelligence. And today, we're happy to announce the business partnership with IBM. IBM is very advanced in terms of cognitive technology and the service called Watson. In United States, there was a quiz program between Watson and human and actually Watson won in the game. And with this field, Watson is very famous and advanced and we are taking a partnership on that and going to sell in the market, especially having such advanced technology, we believe that we'll be able to have a synergy with our Pepper and that also been announced today. In addition to that, subsidiaries of SoftBank, which is SoftBank Mobile, SoftBank Telecom, SoftBank BB, and Ymobile. Those four companies has been merged \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has been announced to merge. And with that, I believe, we'll be able to seek further efficiency of business and operation. So up to here is the domestic communications domain. And going from here is the Sprint. We have entered the United States' market, but recently Sprint in the U.S. announced to record the impairment loss of $2.13 billion. Under the U.S. GAAP, this is recognized as impairment loss, but the accounting principles adopted by SoftBank is IFRS and we don't recognize this impairment loss. Internally, I was saying that because this is going to be recorded \\xe2\\x80\\x93 recording impairment loss in U.S. GAAP, why don't we also record the impairment loss. And we had several sincere discussion, but because we have already adapted this IFRS and under this rule we cannot record this loss, although we would like to. I said we would like to, but that is because from the business accounting wise, I'd rather like to see the conservative view on the business accounting. And whenever it's necessary, I'd rather like to see the early recognition if there is such impairment loss. So that is why that I had a discussion that we rather liked to, but because of the difference of the accounting principles, therefore that we didn't recognize this impairment loss. Under the U.S. GAAP, they recognized or conduct impairment test on individual assets and lower level asset grouping. But on the contrary, when it comes to the IFRS, impairment test is conducted on total of assets. And under the IFRS, when recoverable amount is larger than the net asset carrying amount then there will be no impairment test. So this impairment test is conducted based on the total assets of the Sprint, but not the individual asset. Of course, share price is one of the measurements. And the other one is DCF or the future cash flow are discounted at today's current value minus debt. So compare the share price and with DCF net debt and whichever higher is regarded as recoverable amounts and that is compared with net asset carrying amount. And as a result of the impairment test, impairment loss was not recognized under IFRS method. So we didn't recognize impairment loss because of the difference in accounting policy between Sprint and SoftBank. But whatever the accounting principle is, maybe we should accept humbly the fact that the Sprint booked the impairment loss, and although we didn't book the impairment loss on a consolidated basis, we should pretend that we suffered a loss, so we should try to pursue further efficiency. But as you can see here, the Sprint booked net loss for the past years and that this loss for the current period include the impairment loss. And Sprint business is turning around, but still the company is still booking net loss. And Sprint is proactively spending on CapEx. And because of that, the free cash flow of Sprint remains negative. And with that in mind, I personally think that the impairment loss may need to be recognized on a consolidated basis. But because of the difference in accounting policy between Sprint and SoftBank, we didn't recognize that impairment loss on a consolidated basis. Let me give you the current \\xe2\\x80\\x93 latest status of Sprint management after Marcelo's appointment. I always speak highly of him as a corporate manager, because he built a company from the scratch, which is the Brightstar, and he is well-versed in wireless business. And he is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 fully exercise his experience and expertise in managing Sprint right now. And one of the major focus of Sprint is customer acquisition. And please look at the right-hand side of this graph. This is after Marcelo's appointment. The left-hand side of the graph shows before Marcelo, the Sprint lost customers; but after Marcelo, Sprint starts gaining customers again. And of course, the postpaid customer is more important than other customer segment. And so far, the Sprint lost postpaid customers. But after Marcelo's appointment, the Sprint's net addition trend is turning around. That's a good sign. Postpaid, prepaid, wholesale, altogether the Sprint recorded 1 million net additions, not net loss. That's quite an improvement, but profit-wise, postpaid matters most. And so far, the company suffered loss of postpaid customers, but in the last quarter, the company recorded net addition of postpaid customers. That's a good sign. And next, network, another focus point of Sprint's business. Look at this graph. Well, the higher the number in this graph, the worse. And when it comes to drop call or call drop rate, which means that when you are calling someone then, in the middle of the conversation, the call drops. That's so-called call drop. And according to the data of call drop, a survey by Nielsen, the third-party; of the four carriers in the United States, well, Sprint was the fourth, ranked fourth, or worst, among the four carriers. But recently, the Sprint's call drop rate is improving as a result of the network build effort. Thirdly, the cost reductions. On this front, the Sprint is making progress, making management efficiency better. So customer acquisition, network, and cost management, we are seeing a good sign of improvement, although we don't see a significant improvement yet. Right after our acquisition, the Sprint was behind the top two players, but the top two players are huge players and in this business, the scale matters. So right after Sprint acquisition, we wanted to gain more scale for Sprint by merger, but actually it didn't happen. And so we are in the long and hard battle right now. And because of that, because Sprint is in the middle of long and hard battle, the Sprint booked impairment loss. But let me repeat this, we are seeing a sign of improvement, although the level of improvement is still small. And next, another major business domain of SoftBank's business is Internet business. Under the SoftBank's umbrella, there are lots of Internet companies. One of them, Alibaba, IPO-ed last year, and that's one of the examples of where the SoftBank, the seed sowed by SoftBank, is leaping. And also, we are increasing the investments on Internet area, especially four areas, first of all, transportation area or transportation platform. This is new. And another one, advertising media and games. Another one, e-commerce. And lastly, so-called growth area, our investments on start-ups. So first of all, e-commerce. Alibaba is one of the core business in e-commerce domain. E-commerce \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, Alibaba is growing steadily. And mobile business, or mobile e-commerce of Alibaba, is growing rapidly, literally day-by-day. So I expect Alibaba will grow further. I strongly believe so. Next are the another Alibaba, or second Alibaba in India, that will be Snapdeal. I already announced the investment in Snapdeal last session, that Snapdeal business is growing rapidly. And another e-commerce investment is Tokopedia, which is number one online marketplace in Indonesia, and we are the largest shareholder of Tokopedia. So e-commerce business is growing to be our core of our Internet business. And transportation platform. This is about the taxi-hailing application. United States have seen a growing market of taxi-hailing app service, but actually the same goes for Asia. KuaiDi Taxi in China, GrabTaxi in Indonesia, and Ola in India. Olacabs becomes number one transportation platform in India, and it's still growing rapidly. And next, GrabTaxi, this is number one transportation platform in Southeast Asia. In addition, recently, KuaiDi of Alibaba Group is another one that we participate of the equity method. So here that they are sharing the know-hows each other, and also creating synergies each other and they can grow together, so that the synergy group of SoftBank is increasing share. And the next group is the advertising, medias and games, which is so-called content area. Here too that we've been seeing very much growth. And the latest one is Housing.com, which is online house-hunting platform in India; apartments, houses, real estate. Those are focused on online to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the transaction. This also [ph] is (23:58) SoftBank to become a major shareholder. So these are the area that are focus area of SoftBank, but other than that, we have startups that we've been looking into for the investments. So this is something that we are trying to grow [ph] from the seeds (24:16) one by one. So that's the kind of a big picture of our business strength. So that one is the communications, the other is the Internet services area. So these are the two kind of wheels of cars \\xe2\\x80\\x93 automobiles. So 34 years have passed since the foundation of the company. And at the time of foundation, we have started with the wholesale of PC softwares. Wholesale of PC software [ph] which is difficult to our bank, (24:48) and that has grown to the current SoftBank and that we have changed this for many business domains. But, constantly, we've been focusing on information revolution and also we want to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we want to always develop the latest edge technologies of the information revolutions. And that's always the kind of our focus point. And to make that happen that, we've been having several challenges by launching the infrastructures and we have four years in red for the \\xc2\\xa5100 billion level. And there are several challenges of the bankruptcies and so on. However, somehow, that we've been able to survive and now that we became the current SoftBank. And now that our challenge, current challenge, is Sprint. As I mentioned earlier, it is not something easy. We sincerely accept the recognition of impairment loss by Sprint. However, having said that, I believe there is only a view when we challenge, so that the view is different when you challenge by yourself. So you never see the height. You never understand the height unless you climb it. You never know the depth unless you dive into the river. So that once you challenge, then you'll know what's in front of you. And recently, I think that the Japanese companies should challenge more. And some people say that SoftBank challenge too much, but still I hope that we'll be able to keep challenging. And having a difficulty in Sprint and having a stable stage in domestic communication, there are so many things happening here and there; but still, SoftBank will keep challenging. And we keep these motivations. And that concludes my presentation. Thank you very much. Information Revolution \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Happiness for everyone, so that is always our corporate philosophy of SoftBank. Thank you very much. \",\n",
       " '2014 Q4': \"My name is Son. I'm from SoftBank. Thank you very much for joining today. So, let me go into the presentation for the earnings results. As you know, we have spent for about 30-some years since our foundation of the company and so far, we've been seeing Japan's SoftBank making an investment in overseas companies. That was kind of position that SoftBank used to have but going forward, we are going to the second phase of SoftBank and we're going to be the global SoftBank. Global Softbank also operates the business in Japan as well, so that is a kind of position that we are taking and transforming. From the sense this year, it's going to be the key milestone and also the transition period towards the second phase of SoftBank. Now, let me go into the material. Consolidated results, net sales, as you can see is steady growth, 30% increase. EBITDA, 20% increase. Again, this is making a steady growth. EBIT, 9% decrease. However, as we can see from the bar graph, last year includes the temporary gains from consolidation of GungHo and WILLCOM. The onetime gain was there. I mentioned in last year as well, that this was a temporary gain. And if we exclude such temporary gains and if we only see the organic growth for the operating income, it was actually making 19% increase. So, this again is showing the steady business growth. Net income, 39% increase, again, very steady. Dividend per share, no change in dividend policy. So, the current SoftBank have two business segments. One is Telecom, which is the infrastructure business. The other one is the Internet business. In Internet business, it's not really that we operate 100%, but rather we become the major shareholder owning for about 30% to 40% of the certain group companies, and manage and provide the strategic views for those companies. And first of all, the Silicon part, since the acquisition of Vodafone K.K. and nine years has passed since then, and we are almost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sometime soon celebrating 10-year anniversary, and since then that we made a nine times mobile EBIT. At the time of operation of this business, many people criticized because mobile it has already penetrated well. Why now? Why SoftBank is acquiring such a mobile business and enter into the market? So, there are so many questions like that, but from my understanding, mobile Internet, actually that was a time that the dawn of the mobile internet, very beginning, therefore not buying the matured mobile operator, but actually, we are buying the mobile Internet business. So, that was a kind of a concept. But most people didn't understand what I'm trying to do, but now I believe that it's proven showing this nine times growth in nine years. And this is mainly because smartphone came along and playing the central role in the mobile phone market. And this is still growing and also accessories are also making a quick increase seven times in five years. The network for the SoftBank used to be called as a criticism that it's not making connection. But in the past one year-and-a-half, our network quality has been evolving drastically. And now, almost every day, daily basis, that we are achieving number one connection ratio. So, this is scientific statistics that we get, so that it's very appropriate from any of the base out there. And recently, around June, I believe that there's not many people or less and less people are hearing that because of Softbank, it doesn't make a connection. So, as a result of those efforts, I believe that most of the survey is showing our achievement. Even in the [ph] Yamate (7:44) lines, in congested areas, dense area but still making a good connectivity in the connection speed, communication speed, taking us several angles upwards in nationwide and also we were achieving better than those two other competitors, and this is confirmed every day. About just two years ago, a year-and-a-half ago, many people didn't believe, but even now, our internal people wasn't really sure that this is true, but there is no doubt now that we are achieving so much improvement in our network, so that domestic telecom business has been fully developed and also be able to continuously grow and sustain the steady operations. And I'm very confident that we can have a good steady operation. So, Ken Miyauchi together with me, he's been supporting as a management partner. And Ken Miyauchi is going to be the President and CEO for new SoftBank Corp., and he's going to operate this big corp. Therefore, SoftBank is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or I will say, new SoftBank domestic business-wise, it's going to have a strengthened growth strategy and combined with efficient management, and this needs to be well-balanced in between those two. And also, I'm happy to say that the CapEx has peaked out, and operating income before the depreciation we've been able to generate the growth. Operating cash flow has been making a steady growth so far. We've been spending quite a huge CapEx at the peaks some \\xc2\\xa5700 billion that we have spent such a large CapEx, which is because this is the core and the core of the mobile operations service. And if network is inferior to the competitors, it doesn't make sense, so that is why that the time of the peak that we spent about \\xc2\\xa5700 billion and create the network. But since we've been achieving to a certain extent, so from now on, we will see the peak of the CapEx amount and going down to the normal level which is about \\xc2\\xa5300-some-billion level; and we believe that we'll be able to settle in that range. As a result, take EBITDA minus CapEx, equals to free cash flow. We can start generating a large amount of free cash flow from now on. With such free cash flow, we can pay down our debt. Also, one important subject to discuss is this, Sprint. As you may know, well, our original plan was to merge Sprint and its rival, T-Mobile, so that we can make a strong third-player in the U.S. wireless market. That was what we originally envisioned. But actually it turned out that it would be difficult to happen. So we are going to pursue the way to turn around the Sprint and make the Sprint stronger. And with the appointment of new CEO, Marcelo, from the second half of last year, the Sprint has been on good track of turnaround. Until then, Sprint lost customers every quarter. But since the appointment of Marcelo, that trend was reversed recently. Sprint has regained its confidence in gaining subscribers. Sprint network was poorer than others, but recently network has improved and because of that the Sprint churn rate started showing improvements. Until last year, the Sprint churn rate was worse in the market, but actually it's been improving. The network quality of Sprint was far behind its competitors. But right now the network quality has been improving significantly. Given those facts, especially for the past one-and-a-half months, I stayed up until 2 AM, after midnight to look into or explore the way to optimize and improve Sprint network design, and I'm become confident now about my design idea. And of course, the design has not been implemented yet, but with a new design, we are sure that we can improve Sprint network significantly. Three months ago, I announced that the Sprint needs to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because of the Sprint booking of impairment loss, although that didn't have any impact on our consolidated earnings result, but I said to all of you that we should pretend that we book a loss on a consolidated basis. And with that in mind, we have to be serious about the Sprint operation, but I think we are seeing the good sign of improvement in Sprint finally. Now, from this page on, I'd like to talk about the second stage of SoftBank business, which is centering around Internet business. For the past 10 years, I myself and Sprint management's team had placed focus, the biggest focus on network improvement. Also, I placed over 90% of my energy and time on building a strong and robust network for wireless business. During that time, Internet strategy or Internet-related investments were subject to only 10% or less than 10% of my energy for the past 10 years. But it's during that time, before the past 10 years, when I spent most of my energy on network, my company placed focus on Internet business. So now that our network has improved significantly, I'd like to place my focus back on the Internet business. And one of the core company in our Internet's business segments is Alibaba. Alibaba listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, so I believe that many of you got familiar with the name of Alibaba and the business of Alibaba. But last year, Alibaba's gross merchandise volume exceeded that of Walmart's in the U.S. And Alibaba's gross merchandising volume last year is closing in on that of Walmart worldwide. So, it's just a matter of time for Alibaba to outpace Walmart's worldwide. In the e-commerce market in the world, Alibaba will soon be the number one in many aspects especially in terms of net income. That is true. Alibaba's gross merchandising volume is getting larger and larger, and the growth rate is higher and higher. But it has grown to generate net income of $676 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xc2\\xa5676 billion, excuse me. And I joined Alibaba's Board of Directors meeting last month. At that time, a lot of interesting exchange of information about the future of Alibaba, and I felt confident that there's a bright future ahead for Alibaba. Alibaba has grown significantly for the past 10 years, but still it has a growth potential because of various factors around Alibaba. And I'm really confident about the further growth of Alibaba. And also there's a lot of potential for the further business expansion of Alibaba outside China. And now Yahoo! Japan, Yahoo! Japan has been on growth trends and right now, in pursuit of further growth, Yahoo! Japan has been coming up with a lot of interesting ideas right now. And I place high expectation on the future growth of Yahoo! Japan. For the past 18 months, we acquired one of the largest digital content for smartphone which is gaming for smartphone. Anyone who rules the gaming world could be the ruler of the smartphone digital content world. That's what I said in earlier meetings and Supercell and GungHo occupy the first and second place of the world top grossing game ranking for the past more than 12 months. There are more than 1 million applications thought for smartphone, and out of more than 1 million titles, first place and second place have been occupied by Supercell and GungHo games in terms of top-grossing ranking. That is not easy, but actually, two of our growth companies have achieved that. That sounds too good to be true, but actually that is true. 18 months ago, how many of you could imagine that the Supercell and GungHo stay on the top two places in the grossing game ranking, but actually that is true. They're on the top two ranking. And Snapdeal, Snapdeal's gross merchandising volume increased over 300% year-over-year, and there is no sign of slowing down of growth. Nikesh and I made decision on investment in Snapdeal. We both were involved in negotiations, and we've been supporting the management. And I really think that we did a good transaction here. And likewise, in India, it's like a Uber type of business in India, as you know Uber is mainly in United States. It's still the private company, but actually they are already evaluated for several trillion yen, not yet gone public, but being invested and making a rapid growth. And this company has also the same business model, but at the time that we invested, it was 60% of market share and now grown to 80% market share. So making a great smooth in growth, and also Tokopedia in Indonesia is making a rapid growth as well. In addition, this is also the same business model as Uber which is GrabTaxi. They are providing a service in Asia except for India and they are already been 22 times in 18 months. So these are the companies that we invest and also managing and these are the strategic group companies just a part of it. But we also have a lot of portfolio like these companies and we are very happy to see their growth. So, we have a telecom infrastructure and we have Internet, so those two segments are still in our hands. But always, there is a issue that technical companies face, IT companies, so this company has spent more than 30 years since its foundation. And when we look back actually such an IT tech companies have a common problem and I always feel that. For the past 30 years, what I saw, the partners we had or the friend companies around but they always have common issues, which is so-called 30 years life cycles. So, in this IT industry, this is a growth ratio curve that you can see. So, growth ratio in every 30 years, you don't see any growth anymore. If I pick up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don't want to pick up the names, so I don't want to disrespect so that I don't name it. But you can imagine easily that those big IT guys, big success of the companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there are so many, but in the past 30 years, those companies we believe that they are the one that conquered the world. And actually, they are falling down, picking out, and their growth has been declined and the substantial growth is not been seen anymore, which you can easily imagine, which company I am talking about. So, this is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because they have all common problems, which is the 30 years life cycle and why they have such a life cycle, and there are three. One is the technology. Technologies can obsolete. Founders get older. Business model get older. So, those are the three main reasons why that they have a 30 years sales cycle. So, those three reasons every 30 years, it's going to be obsolete. So, that is kind of a reason why. But we cannot only crying for that. What is the solution? We, at SoftBank, even after 30 years, even in the next 30 years, we never become a big enterprise. We don't want to be the big enterprise. What I'm trying to say is that I don't want to be a big enterprise, big company. That's going to be the failure for us, that's going to be not good for the company. Even after 30 years, we want to be adventurous. We want to be the shining star. We want to be the growing company. Therefore the solution is we, ourselves, has to be disruptive and a group of entrepreneurs. We, ourselves, not to become the big enterprise, normal, traditional white-collar companies, but we, ourselves, have to be with full of energy, ambitious, adventurous, and have to set up a group of entrepreneurs like that. I mentioned earlier that the group strategy of Internet. If so, most of the case, SoftBank becomes a majority of the shareholders, owning about 30% to 40%, and the entrepreneurs like them, taking about 10% or so. And venture capitals take about 5% to 10% in each. SoftBank owns about 30% to 40%. So, we are the major shareholder. So, other major shareholders, together with entrepreneurs like them, we become the partner with a ambitious target. We manage together. We disrupt the business model together, and generate synergies together. That's different from venture capital. The seven years investment we collect, dispose, provide dividends, that's not something that the limitation we have like venture capital does. And also, different from bank, we just don't loan money. And as for the fixed rate for the commission, we are same as them. We are also the group of entrepreneurs with a lot of ambitions and share the same spirit, share the same environment, share the same culture, share the same angle, and run the business model, and being disruptive in the market. So that's the kind of a SoftBank we want to be. Most of the Internet companies in Japan, when they develop to overseas, it's always difficult and challenging. It's because that they always try to keep their business model and put it into the other companies with different employees, different language, different cultures and the Japanese business model is very difficult to develop in overseas. But what I think is that any unique thing, not bringing to the overseas, but what I try to do is, together with the entrepreneurs in the worldwide and we can grow together and study together that's something that we believe is the solution for not to become the big enterprise, traditional big enterprise. And I believe this is very unique, and we are the first one to have such a model. And this is the kind of a base and core for us to enter into the second stage of the SoftBank and keep evolving IT, and we want to promote that and extend that and develop further. And to do so, I'm very happy to tell you that we found a very great partner, Mr. Nikesh Arora. He is also on the stage together with us. And five years ago we have known him and in the past nine months, we have walked together and I have very confidence. He's 10 years younger than me. Since the foundation of SoftBank, I've been working as a President, also served as a CEO. And this time, in Japan, it's different, it's in Japanese. He had the title, but for the English title, I want him to serve as a President. We are going to change the company's name. SoftBank Corp. is going to be SoftBank Group Corporation. So that is the new name for the SoftBank going forward. And this SoftBank Group is playing as a listed company and a holding company as we used to do. But Representative Director and the President that we're going to ask Nikesh to play that role and they're going to keep the Chairman, CEO, English title, I've been serving as the President and CEO. So, my title used to be President and CEO, but for the first time in company's history, there is a man other than me whose title will be President. And my title will be Chairman and CEO of the SoftBank Group Corp. So, since our listing, for the first time, we have another man than myself, who is Nikesh Arora who would serve as President. Actually, his title will be COO and President of SoftBank Group, and Nikesh and I together will lead the SoftBank in its second stage. I'd like to see SoftBank make a sustainable growth, so we'd like to create a sustainable growth. Nikesh, as you may know, used to be number two of Google which is the world's prominent IT company. Actually, he used to be CBO of Google. So, he is well versed in the best technology and best business models of globally famous Internet companies, and also he has great connections with Internet companies. And with his expertise and insight and experience, he could serve as a great partner of me in leading new SoftBank under the confidence that together with Nikesh, we could lead SoftBank to further growth. Thank you very much for your kind attention. We'd like to open the floor for Q&A. \",\n",
       " '2015 Q1': \"I am Son from SoftBank. Since the foundation of the company, we have spend about 30 years, and there are a lot of ups and downs, especially till some years ago, 14 years ago, I think, when we enter into broadband business. We had a big consideration because it was right after the collapse of Internet bubble, and the share price went down by 99%. And at that time, we have started the challenge against one of the biggest companies in Japan, which is NTT Group. So it was really ambitious challenge. Even though I look back now, I still think that it was much very much ambitious challenge. But since then we were able to turn the business of broadband in positive. And also, after that, we have entered into the mobile phone business, which is now the core business of the company. When I look back, there was also another big challenge that we made. In both cases, we were able to make that business in better shape and making a steady growth now. So this is a third challenge in telecom operation, which is a challenge to United States, and that's why that we decided to go for the acquisition of Sprint. I look back now; again, that was also a very ambitious challenge. And that actually is making some reflects to our share price, and I do understand there are lots of considerations over such business from investors and shareholders. About this, I myself in the beginning, I was actually thinking about the consolidation of industry with T-Mobile and Sprint so that we'll be able to challenge the biggest company of those two, AT&T and Verizon. So by having those two companies together, then we'll be able to become the very much big number three player with almost equivalent customer base. We may be able to become number one too. So that was the kind of the picture that I was imagining in that moment. But that merger \\xe2\\x80\\x93 consolidation was less likely to be approved by regulatory by the United States. And I gave up. I lost my confidence. Last fall \\xe2\\x80\\x93 last winter, at the time of earnings results announcement, I caught a cold. I was not feeling well, but also I could say that time I had lost confidence. So that was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's why that I was a little bit humble back then. Back then, I was even thinking about that we may have to go for the choice of selling Sprint. But after then, time goes by. After winter, spring came, summer came, and now that we're in the middle of mid-summer, I totally came back to my energy and my cold went away. And I'm full of confidence now. I can see the picture of our strategy. I came up with a blueprint. I came up with the basic design. And mainly, I'd like to focus on those designs and in the new pictures for today's announcement. So let me go into the details. So this is the conclusion. We are committed to turnaround of Sprint. So not only our wish, but we do see the very concrete strategy tactics. So that is why I'm so confident today to make such announcement. Before going to details, first, I'd like to give you the overview of our consolidated business performance. But today, because I like new things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 SoftBank loves new things, new challenges \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so this is the world-first earnings results announcement by robot. So I'd like Pepper to announce to you the earnings results. Pepper? See? Pepper Robot, on behalf of myself, he's going to announce you the earnings results, only the first half though. Are you okay, Pepper? Please do make it good. You're nervous, huh? Yes, I am serious. You have to do it. Are you okay? But do your best. I'm very much expecting on you. You did a great job. I was bit nervous about that, and actually you were nervous, but you did a great job. All right, Pepper. Let me talk about Pepper for Biz now. We start selling Pepper for general consumers, but Pepper will be starting business career. Pepper for general consumers sold out in just a minute in June and July, 1,000 for each. Yes, our Pepper is more popular than we expected. Next offering is on August 29th. Maybe Pepper will be sold out in just a minute, but so far, we can sell as much as we produce. And earlier, I got a question about the possibility of increase of production, and yes, we try hard to increase production. From October, Pepper for Biz program will start, so Pepper will start working at companies. And prior to that, from July, Mizuho Bank started using Pepper at their branches to provide useful information to their customers. And there are some other companies who have started using Pepper. But under the Pepper for Biz program, the Pepper will be sent to companies at monthly pay of \\xc2\\xa555,000. I hope Pepper will be used by different types of companies and they would enjoy Pepper's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 funky side of Pepper or fun side of Pepper, and serious side of Pepper. And Pepper could attend customers or Pepper could make presentation of products for customers. Actually, three days ago, it struck me that maybe I could use a Pepper to make presentation of earnings result on behalf of me, and that's why Pepper made presentation as you saw. And I hope various companies could use Pepper for business. I hope you're interested in Pepper for Biz program. Of course. Maybe it's my turn, so I'll hand over this presentation. So thank you for your good job, Pepper. Well done, Pepper. Yes, he did a great job. So, collaborative presentation with Pepper \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's the first half of this presentation session. So now, let me move onto the second half of this session. So as Pepper said, this business is making a steady growth, as you saw and explained by Pepper. But the most conservation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of course, myself, not relying on a robot, but myself, actually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 involved personally in Sprint business. And we are working very hard to make the company turn around. As mentioned earlier, 14 years ago we entered into telecom business, Yahoo! BP in 2001. Right after the burst of the Internet bubble, the most suffering time, we entered into the fixed broadband in 2006, when the fixed broadband turned into positive. But at the same time, we announced the acquisition of Vodafone K.K. And I said, we'll be seeing, facing the mobile Internet era sometime soon. And back then, people said that the [indiscernible] (22:25) of SoftBank throw one trade union away. So that was a kind of headlines of newspaper back then. And most of the people said SoftBank Mobile is going to fail. But as you see, in nine years, our mobile operating income went nine times. So as you can see, the red, everything was going down. But after then, after the SoftBank Mobile, it turned around and now showing nine times of operating income. It is on track now. And now that we're facing another new challenge, that is what SoftBank sale is. And three years ago, to look for further opportunity for growth, we entered into U.S. market. At that moment, United Sates were actually asking for the higher costs compared to Japan and also the speed of connectivity was slower than Japan. So, high price and lower speed. That was the situation in the United States, and we're challenged for that, then entered into the market. As mentioned earlier, the first strategy was to have industry consolidation by combining number three and number four player to become number one, aim for the number one in the market. So that the big strategy back then, but it didn't \\xe2\\x80\\x93 went through because less likely to receive the approval by regulatory in the United States. So that assumption went away. Under such circumstance, I was, honestly speaking, disappointed. However, we did not give up. Since then, every day, day after night, how can we turn that business around, not running away, but facing the reality, and solve the situation. So we had a thorough discussion between the management of United States and Japan. And I myself, almost every night, we start a conference call from 10 o'clock with engineers, and it ends around 2 o'clock in the morning. So almost every day, regardless of weekends, we discussed about the next-generation network of Sprint. And I myself involved in details and discussed that with engineers. As a result, we are now seeing the solution. That's something that we have done in Japan. It's not only specific to Japan. Actually those are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some of that are universal we can also use and replicate to other place, and we recognize that. So what we are selling in telecom business one and only product, is actually network. If network is not good, regardless how hard you sell and how hard you do the marketing or how hard you do the price competition, but that's only one-time thing. The product, almost the handset, is about the same amongst the peers, iPhone, Galaxy and other Android handsets. So those handsets cannot be differentiated anymore. Then, of course they can do the simple price competition, but more importantly, we have to make the strongest network. And to create the strongest network, it requires the huge amount of CapEx. And under such dilemma, how can we solve the issue? That was the question. So we had a very serious discussion with minimum CapEx requirements and make the strongest network. So that's, somehow, that we wanted to achieve. And now that we have a design for it, and the design that we're very confident to make it happen, so that this strongest network design that we are enhanced right now, reach minimum requirements for the CapEx. So, in the past, Sprint used to have a CapEx plan. Of course, the amounts for the original CapEx plan has been reduced and also minimized the schedule, timeline, and still we can achieve or even surpass the quality of competitors' network. So we are now ready for that design. So I myself, as mentioned earlier, personally involved and also discussed with Sprint engineers and SoftBank engineers, and we have come to the conclusion now. So what we've achieved in SoftBank, that we achieved nine times of operating income. So we made a big turnaround of the company. How did we do that? That's the kind of a track record we have here. One is the OpEx reduction, and the other is maximize CapEx efficiency. So with minimum CapEx, and create a number one network. So when you look at this, at the time of Vodafone K.K., operating income was increasing every year and the revenue sales was decreasing. So sales decreasing, operating expense increasing meaning that the operating income decreasing every year. After our acquisition, we turned around and the first thing that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what we did was to reduce OpEx largely. We cannot increase sales all of a sudden because that may spread damage to customer base, cannot be healed right away. So the first step was to reduce the OpEx largely, and then we can do the price initiative and so that we can get the customer back. And on the next step, that we create and build the number one network. So those are the kind of three steps we have followed at the time of SoftBank Mobile. So this is the fact, 2006 to 2014. This is the cumulative number of CapEx. Actually, SoftBank is the worst. So once again, when we look back, our CapEx amount is the lowest in accumulated base. However, connectivity \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when you look on your right-hand side, SoftBank used to be said that our connectivity is very bad. You have the worst amongst the competitors back then. But that has been improved, and make a number one position in connectivity and speed. So there's less CapEx. Of course, if you can spend so much money in creating the connectivity, high connectivity and high speed, that's easy thing to do, as a matter of fact. Just pay a lot of money to vendors. You can buy a lot of network equipment. And also, in the beginning, we had only spectrum, which has a technicality in connectivity back then. And how hard I explained, that was only the excuse. So that is why that we had so hard to make our network better, although spectrum allowed to us was difficult to have better connectivity. But we made so much effort in detail to make our position better. That's something that's not visible. And also, three years ago, that we have allocated with the 900 Platinum Band, because the competitors back then already had the 800 band. But finally, three years ago, we have allocated with this Platinum Band. And as a result, what we have done so far with still small efforts in culmination of those test things, come to the best result with this good connectivity and higher speed. And that know-how, probably, that we'll be able to apply to Sprint as well. So that's what we've done in Japan, will be applied to Sprint. And the same success pattern will be also repeated and duplicated in Sprint. So one is the large OpEx reduction and also the maximized CapEx efficiency. So these two are the key to Sprint's improvement. So SoftBank EBITDA margin \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is the EBITDA margins. And you see the big drop, but that's the SoftBank; it has been improved. But Sprint, around 2006, they were actually better than the SoftBank. So, their EBITDA margin was higher than SoftBank, but that was declining one year after another. And then, with our acquisition, of course, have a tough time, but still making the better results in EBITDA margin and turning around. So here, with what we have done in Japan, we will b \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now minimize the OpEx and increase the EBITDA margin. Spending less on CapEx and achieve a better network \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's what we did in Japan, and same thing should happen to Sprint. And we're going to make that happen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 less spending, better network. Once that is achieved, then Sprint will turn around. So, less spending with better network, that's the basic idea, but can it be possible in the United States, which is much, much larger than Japan? And actually, the Sprint engineers were dubious my idea, and that they asked us to spend trillion yen of money for the next-generation, but actually, I rejected their proposal. So I came up with alternative plan which requires less CapEx, but that would result in better network. And Sprint team said that would not be possible when they first heard about my proposal, but I counter-argued them and I said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now I have successfully convinced them that my idea would work. And now Sprint and SoftBank engineer teams work together to achieve or to build the next-generation network, and they are working out detailed plans to make that happen. And with the new network plan, I'm now confident about the turnaround of Sprint. Another reason why Sprint was in need of cash. Well, in the case of SoftBank, well, SoftBank started installment billing for devices, and actually SoftBank Mobile was the first in the world to offer installment billing for devices. When we first announced that system, our people started criticizing that maybe such installment billing plan was a kind of measure for window-dressing, and some hedge funds started short-selling of SoftBank shares because nobody believed that installment billing would work. And someone even started saying that SoftBank was trying to do window-dressing. But actually, KDDI and Docomo copied our practice of installment-based device selling. That speaks for the fact that our practice was right. And actually, AT&T and Verizon have adopted installment-billing-based sale of devices. But with installment sale, we successfully reduced the churn rate. And also, thus, Japanese customers like high school students used to upgrade their devices within six months, but that such weird practice stopped with installment billing. But \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and actually, we started securitization of accounts receivable to finance our working capital. Now, Sprint had adopted installment billing system, and they went further by offering a leasing program. Now, to finance their working capital, they could use lease financing; the device financing using leases. Hence, they are preparing for establishing a device-leasing company now. So, so far, there are two big spending items, CapEx for network, but that could be reduced dramatically. And another spending item, which is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that could be covered by lease finance. So that way, Sprint could reduce OpEx spending. With all those measures, Sprint could start repaying their debt. Remember, SoftBank started repaying the debt for Vodafone acquisition, and actually, we paid off the debt relating to the Vodafone acquisition ahead of schedule. And same could happen to Sprint. For the past few months, the people speculated that Sprint will be in short of cash. But Sprint can manage to finance their business by reducing OpEx and by reducing CapEx spending for network and also for device. They could start device financing using leases. So that way Sprint could pay down debt and their net interest-bearing debt could decrease. And here is the debt-to-EBITDA ratio. When we acquired Vodafone, Japan's unit, that was 6.2 times, which is much higher than the current Sprint debt-to-EBITDA ratio. People said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 criticize that Sprint is heavily borrowing, but actually, SoftBank was heavily indebted in the past when we acquired \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when SoftBank acquired Vodafone Japan's unit. But SoftBank reduced the debt-to-EBITDA ratio significantly, and that could happen to Sprint as well. And we are sure about the strategy to reduce the Sprint debts, and we are almost finalizing the execution plan. So all we need to do is to execute the plan. Of course, we are going to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we may be needing to devise such plan, but in a little bit. But we are confident that we can execute that plan to produce result. And for the past year, we tried to come up with solutions for turning around. And as a result, we are seeing the sign of turnaround. Before Marcelo joining Sprint, Sprint kept losing customers. But once Marcelo joined Sprint, net loss of customers stopped. And here is churn. The Sprint churn rate had been high. Actually it was worst in the Sprint history. That was before Marcelo joined. But now the churn rate is the lowest in Sprint history and, as a result, adjusted EBITDA has been increasing. We see a sign of turnaround, and same goes for operating income and net income. Actually, Sprint has been recording net losses, but now we see the sign of turning around. The net income would be recorded. So Sprint from now on will be able to pay down debt and here are our plans. There should be no increase of public bonds, and instead Sprint should pay down debt. And also, there should be no equity financing on the Sprint side. So we're making a drastic charge here. And in summary, the real improvement \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so, that's reduced OpEx and also \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sorry. So the real improvement that we need to make reductions and also maximizing CapEx efficiency. But at the same time, aim to be number network. As a result, we'll be able to enhance customer acquisitions. So with those four points, Sprint will be able to make the company turn around, and I'm very confident about that. In summary, we're seeing light at the end of the tunnel. It's been a long and dark tunnel, but now we've been seeing light there at the end. With the same type of expression, I did that same thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said the same thing a few years ago,. That was the time at Yahoo! BB and we're making loss for about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion every year. And also, we were so divested that I couldn't play golf, no weekends for about a year. So without weekends, no holidays, the New Years, end of the year, and we made a so hard effort to turn the Yahoo! BB around. A little bit before then, to turn the company around, when we see that kind of a picture and strategy, that time I also said the same thing. See, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel, and two years later, actually, the company turned around and turned into positive. And I feel the same way for Sprint again. My feeling and the people's feeling may have a little bit of time difference, about two years, I think. So you may think, why you're making such aggressive comment? Because I cannot really discuss the detail, concrete plans. And also, there's not yet a big improvement in the results or achievement. Of course, we've been seeing signs of turnaround, but at this moment, you may think that I shouldn't make such a big smile here. But actually, I feel exactly the same way at the time of Yahoo! BB when they were very bottom of the business. But at the same time, I already saw the light at the end of the tunnel. I was so excited back then, and I feel exactly the same way for Sprint now. So are you selling Sprint? Do you have any intention to sell Sprint? If you ask me, I have no intention to sell Sprint. I'm so happy to buy that company. That's my honest opinion now. So, as I mentioned in the beginning, Sprint, committed to turn around. So, not only in my guts, but we do have a detailed plan and concrete ideas, and that to be executed. So with the SoftBank share price actually now undervalued \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's how I feel personally. Number of shares \\xe2\\x80\\x93 value of number of shares \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only the listed securities that we have, about some \\xc2\\xa510 trillion equivalent. Market capital of SoftBank, about \\xc2\\xa58 trillion something. Isn't there something wrong? So, rather than I say that by myself, I show it as my behavior. That's why that we come to the conclusion of buying back our shares, own shares. Not much money; not much amount; it's about \\xc2\\xa5120 billion. That's the maximum. But still, we do want to do some investment activities as well here and there. So we need some room for the money too, but as our feeling goes, we believe that our share price is undervalued, we will keep investing. But thinking about all those, probably we can get the best return from SoftBank's share investment. So that's one of my ideas as well. So that is why that we're announcing this share buyback program. So that is all for my presentation for today. Thank you very much. \",\n",
       " '2015 Q2': \"My name is Son. Thank you very much for coming. So, the earnings results announcement, it may not be appropriate to comment this, but SoftBank Group actually became the champions of Japan in two years in a row. Baseball is not a one-man game. Even though you have one great player, but that doesn't give you a championship. I think it needs a balance. So, having the teamwork and building such a team requires so many preparations and also need some luck. So many things is necessary to become champion. But we are fortunate in our management of the business. We have several lucks as well. And we've been able to run this business for the past 30-some years, and able to keep growing the business itself. Of course, we had the ups and downs in the past. But what I think recently is that so many seeds that we've been planting have been making a growth, and it's making a good, positive signs as well. And the content of today's announcement actually shows our steady growth. And I think that you'd be able to see that from today's announcement. One thing, which is not enough, is Sprint that I can say, but this, too, actually from the beginning of this year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the beginning of this year, I honestly say this at the earnings announcement that I caught a cold back then. I wasn't still feeling well, so that I said I'm not that confident and I said that there is a tough and long road ahead in terms of Sprint. That was my honest comment back then. However, now, spending this past three months, four months, actually, I regained \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I'm more confident in Sprint. And honestly speaking, we have seen the clear view of making Sprint's turnaround. Of course, the execution is going to be necessary going forward, one by one, but I, myself, personally, now see the clear picture and clear road to go in terms of Sprint's turnaround. I think if even though that you have lots of challenges, but once \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you don't see any way to solve that, that's the most stressful moment, a lot of frustrations. And that's the time that you have to consider a lot. But once you see \\xe2\\x80\\x93 although that you have a lot of challenges ahead, but once you see the design for the solution, or the hint for the solution, and the only thing you need to do is just to execute, then even though that you have to climb a high mountain, but still you'll be able to enjoy that. Climbing itself is going to be fun for you because you already see the picture of the mountain. You know where to go. So, that's just before the field trip or just before you climb the mountain, you are excited to climb that. At the time we launched Yahoo! BB, in the beginning we have a big risk in the financials and we never see the light ahead of us. We are in the long tunnel there. But in the beginning of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the middle of the course, we start seeing the light and also seeing the light ahead of the tunnel and seeing the solutions. Then, although, that you are working in a very dark tunnel, but still you have a light ahead, you know where to exit. Then that you'll become more excited to work along. I, myself, is now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is involved in the network discussion every night from 10:00 PM for the Sprint network. In that time, it's actually I'm so excited, I'm still looking forward to start this discussion every night in 10:00 PM and that sometimes it goes on to 1:00 AM or 2:00 AM, but actually this time is the most exciting time for me every day. So, for me, this is very enjoyable moment for myself and also, looking forward to start this meeting every day. That's how I am excited and I'm glad about the situation. So, now, I'd like to go into the details of the presentation. Consolidated results, as I mentioned earlier, net sales, EBITDA, EBIT, so these are the kind of performance for the core business and each is making a steady growth. Net income is negative, but because the first half of the previous year, Alibaba went public and at that time, we had a one-time gain I mentioned at the earnings call. But Alibaba doesn't go public every year, so that this was the once-in-a-long-time deal event in a group company and the one-time gain was included in the first half of previous term. So, without that, so actually that is showing the negative figure in net income this year and each actually making a steady growth. And I'm happy to announce that steady growth. And net sales by segments, EBITDA, again Domestic Telecom is making a steady growth, Yahoo! and also Others, but Sprint actually, you can see that it's showing the good sign of turnaround. EBIT again, each making a good steady growth. In total, EBIT is 21% increase. So, with this size, \\xc2\\xa5685.8 billion in first year is showing quite a good growth so far. So, as we have a two-business portfolio, one is the operating assets. The other is investment assets. Operating assets, Domestic Telecom of SoftBank, Sprint, Yahoo! Japan, and others, and amongst those, the main asset, which is Domestic Telecom that I would like to go into detail. In Domestic Telecom, we have \\xc2\\xa5424.7 billion EBIT was recorded. Some say that they're still profitable, that kind of criticism that I hear, but as a company growing our EBIT is something that we've been making every efforts to do so. So, that's what we are as a corporate management so that we would like to put the every efforts to keep growing the EBITDA, while meeting all the kinds of demands and needs by customers by providing the higher or advanced products or services so that we will be able to provide a variety of the line-ups, and at the same time, compete each other. iPhone sales share in the domestic market is number one. And also, in Android, year-on-year basis \\xe2\\x80\\x93 year-over-year basis, 21% increase for the SoftBank Mobile and Ymobile, which is the fully consolidated subsidiary. Adding all those, Android is also taking 21% of the market shares. And the most important service is the network. Handset is something similar by competitors, so we have to be the best network in the market. And I'm so happy to announce that we've been able to achieve number one positions in network in two years a row, and for the Japan corporate network service, and also number one in cloud service as well. So from the customer satisfaction point of view, SoftBank was not too good, but recently, that has been improved in steady basis. Domestic Telecom ARPU, \\xc2\\xa54,230 is now becoming \\xc2\\xa54,190. So, the Telecom ARPU is reducing, declining, but the service ARPU has increased compared to the same period last year. So, service ARPU, which includes content or other services that we provide and that needs to be expand, or we need to put more efforts to expand the area going forward. Mobile pricing is too expensive. That's something that we've been told. But because we run the company in both Japan and United States, and I do know the difference of those two markets. But at least what I can say is that the telecom network in Japan is much advanced compared to that of U.S. in terms of coverage, in terms of speed. I believe that we are the most advanced telecom network in the world, and such the advanced network service is now provided to the customers in much cheaper price compared to United States. And at the same time, we are providing iPhone in the cheapest price, is also Japan. So, that kind of angle, difference, that needs to be recognized. And I hope that the people understand that angle and so Japan is not always expensive, but iPhone which is available in the world, but actually we're providing in the cheapest price. And also the best network in a most reasonable price is provided in Japan, and amongst those that the SoftBank is the operator that provides the best of best networks. SoftBank sells not only mobile services, but also fiber-optic broadband services. And in that market, SoftBank is the fastest-growing business in Japan. The fiber-optic broadband service for home and if that service is bundled with mobile services, customer can enjoy more than subscribing a single service as a standalone basis. Other companies offer cable services, and they combine that service with pay-channel services, and such pay-channel services are provided on the fixed schedule. But what we are providing is different. The infrastructure for the services, FTTH, based on the fiber optics, and that content is provided on-demand, not on the fixed schedule. So, customers can enjoy whenever they want to enjoy content. I think that such an on-demand service will become the norm in the global markets. And in that market, on-demand video service, Netflix is the biggest company in the world in terms of number of subscribers and number of contents, and we are partnered with Netflix. And in Japan we are the sole provider of Netflix service, so we are always ahead of the time and provide the latest services to customers. Like I said earlier, the network is the biggest service we can provide to the customers. And here is the network performance. Our connectivity is the best in Japan, and the speed is the fastest in Japan. These results are not from our own survey, but also based on the third-party surveys. Even the surveys by the third-parties, the SoftBank's data connectivity was number one and the speed was the fastest. So, we provide the most advanced network service in the world. Recently, media reports that rates plan or pricing in Japan is extremely high compared to other countries, and we will take that seriously and so we will make effort to deliver diversified services for customers with different needs. If customers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the light users, we will provide the services that could meet such light users' needs. And for the sophisticated customers, we will provide sophisticated services. So far, we spent CapEx heavily on network, especially for tower to build base stations. In the past, number of towers for base stations was smaller compared to our competitors. So, we increased the number of base stations on towers in Japan and once a tower is built, that could serve for 50 years. And we have built the necessary number of base stations already, so we don't have to spend so much CapEx like we did before anymore. And so we can expect the increase in free cash flow dramatically. And this number is up to first half of this year, this fiscal year, but from a next period on, the free cash flow will grow further, meaning that we could use the free up cash onto investments. Now here is one big challenge faced with us; that is Sprint. Let me give you some update on efforts made by Sprint so far. Marcelo became CEO about a year ago, and here is before and after Marcelo. And as you can see, left to the red line is before Marcelo. And this is about postpaid net additions, and postpaid customers account for 90% of the income generated by Sprint. And so far, the postpaid customers decreased every month before Marcelo joined the company. But after Marcelo joined, the postpaid net additions increased every quarter. And here is comparison with competitors of Sprint. All other competitors saw decrease in net addition year-over-year, but only Sprint showed year-over-year increase. So, Sprint is gaining momentum when it comes to net additions of postpaid. And if it is compared with other companies, only Sprint is showing the growth trend. And this is about the smartphone postpaid customers, which is the premium customers in terms of profits. Because tablets is not making a fat profit, so the smartphone or handsets is the key for profitability. Hence, before Marcelo joined the company, the postpaid handset net additions was below zero. But after Marcelo joined, it's been increasing. And finally, the net additions of the handset customers is above zero 237,000. That's a good sign. And this is about the prime customers. In United States, there are two types of customers, prime customers and sub-prime customers. And the profit per customer is different. And some customers are turned down at the credit check when they applied for subscription. And before Marcelo joined, many of sub-prime customers came to Sprint because they were turned down by other carriers. So Sprint were able to acquire new customers, but they were sub-prime customers, and they were not able to keep paying their services, and thus they churned or they left. But after Marcelo joined, the Sprint tightened their credit screening, so the Sprint started acquiring prime customers. So, Sprint is posting net additions these days, but this is just the increasing number of customers. This is increasing the number of prime customers. So the customer mix have changed, and increased the prime customer percentage is a key for profitability. And as you can see, the prime customer gross additions increased 10% year-over-year. That's another good sign. And as a result, including the credit tightening, the present Sprint's churn rate fell to the lowest in the Sprint's 20-year history, which is 1.54%. It's far from low, yet compared to the prior years, it's pretty low because if you acquire customers, you have to pay cost. But if customers are sub-prime customers and many of them churn or leave the company before paying back all the debt. So the churn is impacting bottom line of company business. Of course, another reason for the decline of churn is because of the improvement of network. Sprint has a 2.5 gigahertz spectrum, so binding 2.5 gigahertz plus 2.5 gigahertz, and they have introduced the carrier [ph] regulations (24:07) advanced than the competitors. Thanks to that, they were able to increase the download speed by 66%. With that the complaints in the past of mal-connectivity and so on has been improved dramatically. In the same, iPhone average download speed is also showing a great progress. So, with those efforts, after Sprint joining SoftBank Group, adjusted EBITDA has been showing a steady growth. Operating income also showing the turnaround, it's another good news. Net income, still negative, but actually that negative amount has been reduced. So, the difference in between the operating income and net income is the interest, so once reducing the debts and reducing the interest payments, then that is going to be contributing to the positive net income going forward. And liquidity, how much do they have? You see the colored bar on your left. It's their current liquidity. As of today, these are the amount, but how much do they have in cash and cash equivalents? So, in Japanese yen, it's about \\xc2\\xa5700 billion, equivalent cash and cash equivalents are there in their hands. And notes and loan maturities for this fiscal year is about \\xc2\\xa50.7 billion, next fiscal year about \\xc2\\xa53.7 billion, so that they already have enough liquidity for the source of repayments. So, they have liquidity. They have variety of the financing. So, our earnings call in three months before, I touched on the leasing company as the one option of the variety \\xe2\\x80\\x93 diversification of financing and sometime this month, I believe the first round of the leasing company execution is going to be happening. That's how we prepare right now, and we are in a final preparation stage to make that happen. So, there are three strategies that I would like to touch on for the Sprint's turnaround: first is OpEx reduction or fixed cost reduction; second, the voice network improvements; and the increased financing options. Those three are the key strategy. And the first, the OpEx reduction, sustainable run rate reductions by \\xc2\\xa52 billion or more. So, \\xc2\\xa52 billion or more. So, this is the sustainable run rate happening every year. That's something that we are prepared for. We have about 470 programs to reduce the OpEx, and we've been running those initiatives and programs at the same time. So, with which item, how and what that do we need to reduce? So, we have about 470 programs up and running right now to reduce the total OpEx. So, minimum annual run rate reduction-wise, we are expecting $2 billion sustainably. And to make that happen, we, at the same time, like to recall the one-time cost. So, as the one-time cost expected, $1 billion to $1.2 billion. So, starting from the second half of this year to next fiscal year, that this one-time cost is expected, but at the same time, we are planning to achieve this sustainable run-rate reduction. So, as of cost effectiveness, I believe this is worth spending, and we do see the clear view on those initiatives. And design preparation is about to complete to be ready for the execution. So, that's why that I have more confidence in the turnaround of Sprint. And the first \\xe2\\x80\\x93 second is the network. So, I mentioned that the network is improving. Churn is becoming better. And for the next-generation network, I myself have been involved starting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the meeting starting from 10:00 every night to 1:00 AM or 2:00 AM midnight. So, this is very exciting work that I've been involved with our engineers and our \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sprint's engineers that we've been working on the detailed design for the next-generation network. And for me, this is just a time of joy. This is just a time of fun for me. So, I really enjoy this meeting. So, after all the work I have done in the day, and now after then that I joined this network meeting, which is something that really makes me happy. And by spending such a time with all of them, we aim to be number-one network in United States. And I have more confidence to be able to achieve that target. So, with the minimum \\xe2\\x80\\x93 minimum CapEx and OpEx that we'd be able to achieve that, that's how I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have been designing. But to make that reality, we do need to spend 18 months to 24 months. But this is very exciting as well. Through the board's increasing financing options, as I mentioned earlier, leasing company, so we sell handset in this. But to vendors, we have a payment cycle in 30 days. So, payment in 30 days, but the collection of the cost from customers is over 24 months and [ph] is installed by (30:58) over 24 months. So, that makes you short of money. And for that, by having \\xe2\\x80\\x93 setting up the leasing company separately, this company is going to be the owner of the handsets. So, from leasing company to Sprint that the money goes back, then for those customers who buy handsets in lease have to wait for about two years, but have to pay the vendors in 30 days. So, by setting up this leasing company, this gap we'll be able to fulfill. And we have pretty much prepared for this structure. And one initial round to be executed, we are planning to execute it sometime this month. And once this happens and thus it is launched, then we will see the [indiscernible] (32:02), and also reduce the cost expense and CapEx, then the necessary money is going to be reduced. As a result, borrowings, especially bonds, corporate bonds repayment is going to start. So starting from next year, those money is going to be the source for the repayments, redemption of the bonds. So, when SoftBank acquired Vodafone, our plan, original plan was to redeem over 10 years, repay over 10 years, actually, that happened in four years. We are able to complete paying in four years. Of course, Sprint will not be able to do in four years, but at least, starting from next year, they will be able to start the repayment of the corporate bonds, which is in the net interest-bearing debt. And along with that, the total debt, the redemption of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by starting a redemption repayment of the bonds, that we will be able to reduce the interest payment. As a result, net income will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is going to show a turnaround. So, that's a kind of a basic design for the Sprint turnaround. So we saw three, which is OpEx reduction, network improvements and increased financing options. So, we saw three strategies. We believe that Sprint will be able to turn around and make that sustainable, and I have more confidence in making that happen. And now, other than telecom, especially in Internet segment, Yahoo! Japan is growing steadily, and especially in advertising revenue, because customers are migrating to smartphones from PC, then the unit price for advertisement is smaller in smartphone compared to that of PC. So that structurally, the advertisement revenue is decreasing by having a migration of customers from PC to smartphone. But now, Yahoo! Japan, by scrolling this screen, you see the Yahoo! main page and also the advertisement and changing the scheme of displaying the advertisement, they were able to increase the unit price of that advertisement and also advertising revenue. With that, the Yahoo!'s advertising business is back on growth track again. And another management challenge of the Yahoo! was the growth of e-commerce. Rakuten and Amazon are growing their e-commerce business, but Yahoo! Japan's e-commerce business posted negative growth so far. But about a year ago, Yahoo! Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Yahoo! announced E-Commerce Revolution initiative. And since then, their e-commerce has been growing in Yahoo! Japan. And actually, annual growth rate is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 might be higher than that of other companies. So, the trend reversed. Transaction value of Shop Yahoo! on e-commerce site has been growing dramatically and rate of growth might be larger than Yahoo! Japan's competitors. And the reasons behind are: number one, the number of merchants on the Yahoo! site increased dramatically and the more merchants means more items to offer. And, of course, that's increased the appeal of Yahoo! site. And, of course, the more merchant means more competition leading to competitive prices and that's another appeal to customers. So, I expect Yahoo! Japan's e-commerce to grow further. Here is the scorecard of three key businesses, namely Domestic Telecom, Sprint or U.S. Telecom and Internet. And as you can see in the middle, Sprint has yellow sign. But like I said, we see the light at the end of the tunnel already. And now, let me move on to the investment assets, and first of all, e-commerce. Alibaba, as you may know, Alibaba has outpaced Walmart on a global scale in terms of gross merchandising volume. And revenue increased 32% year-on-year. And, in particular, the mobile revenue increased three times. Now, people talked much about China's GDP growth rate, that will be 7% or below 7%, but Alibaba's growth rate is 32% and net income on non-GAAP basis increased 36% year-on-year. Now, here's Indian e-commerce operator, Snapdeal, and gross merchandising volume grew 223% year-over-year. And here's a Korean player, Coupang, retail revenue increased 531% year-on-year, that's respectable number. And next, transportation segment. Uber is dominating United States and European markets, but Ola is dominating Indian market. It now has 80% market share. Ola's monthly booking requests increased 30 times year-over-year and rate of growth is not slowing down. And let's look at other Asian countries. This GrabTaxi offers the similar service as Ola's in Asian countries other than India and their quarterly bookings increased eight times. Alibaba and Tencent. Next. Excuse me. The Kuaidi Taxi. This company received a strategic support from Alibaba and Tencent, and the number of likes increased four times. Next, games and apps. Game business is in matured stage, so we cannot expect dramatic growth as we saw in the past. Yet, these businesses can consistently grow in revenue and profit. And here is a mobile app ad network, and this is InMobi. InMobi offers services in more than 190 countries and monthly ads impressions leaped 100 billion and number of active users on a quarterly basis has leaped 1 billion. So this could become the world number one company in this area. Next, fintech. This is quite new, but this is expected to grow rapidly. Banks around the world and investors around the world place high expectation on this area. And we have invested in SoFi. This is already a leading company in this field with a growth potential. The company started with the student loan, but they are targeting highly-privileged University students only, meaning that rate of that loan, that debt is pretty small. And thus, the SoFi secure the profits and they are expanding business in other areas like home mortgages and personal loans. And here is the funded amount, actual results. It started with about \\xc2\\xa510 billion in 2012. But now, it's about over \\xc2\\xa5300 billion as of September 30. That's quite a growth, but this company's momentum will not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 momentum will continue and I place high expectation on SoFi with its growth potential. So, we are adding new portfolio investments, and they are exciting portfolios, and we will focus on maximizing value of portfolio companies. Nikesh is leading that activity. And Nikesh and his team are having close contact with managements of such companies where we're investing. Before Nikesh joined the company, investments in startups was like my hobby. That was not my full-time job. But once Nikesh joined the company, we have full-time team working on investment. And the team have worked hard to support the investing companies, so that their investing companies can grow in efficient way at the fastest possible pace. So, the largest Internet company in the world is Google. And Nikesh used to lead the business operation of that world's largest Internet company, Google. And now, Nikesh joined us, and Internet companies is not just a portfolio. We generate cash flow from telecom business and with that cash flow we make investments. But we don't randomly invest in companies. We are focusing on Internet companies, and then we select the candidate companies [ph] they are accrued (44:28) and with a view to generating synergies with the investment portfolios. So, we don't settle for the current status. We always work toward further growth, and we will sow seeds for the further growth. Thank you very much for your attention.\",\n",
       " '2015 Q3': \"So, looking at equity market or the foreign exchange market, seeing a lot of volatile situation under such circumstance. Having a smile like me, looks like not appropriate for the situation. But me myself, as a management, I'm very fulfilled and very excited and spend every day. Looking back when we started the service of Yahoo! BB and spend about four years with negative figures. And we recovered and turned around the business and turn it into black. So, experiencing such a bottom situation is very difficult, but actually we see the light throughout the tunnel. And we had a confidence in our self that we'd be able to make this happen with this business model. And when we have a picture in my head, as a strategy and tactics. And as a management, once we have a confident, I have a confident in myself, remaining things that need to be happened is execution. So that's why that I was so excited that then, as a management, I had a very good taste. I think that for many of you may feel that the SoftBank is having a headache with Sprint and having suffering situation. And many of you may concern and worried about us. And I believe that has been reflected to the share price of SoftBank in many ways. But having said that, me myself, last year, about the same time last year, I said that it will be a long journey to make the turnaround in Sprint and we were not able to see the clear view on how to make it happen. But compared to that situation, now, I have a picture now. I see the future and I am confident to make that happen. So, I am so much excited and very happy. So spending every day. When we wake up in the morning. I'm so excited to spend the day. It may be different from many of you in the market in how I feel. There is a big gap in between, a huge gap in between my feeling and how the marketer is feeling. But at the same time, at the time that we have this much of gap, it may be the opportunity for the investors' point of view as well and I think this is an opportunity from a business point of view as well. Now, let me go into the presentation. Consolidated results; here you see net sales, EBITDA, EBIT, net income, everything going smoothly. Net income, last year, we had Alibaba IPO. So there was a onetime gain along with the Alibaba IPO, but we don't have that in this year. Therefore, if we exclude Alibaba IPO onetime gain, it was 38% increase. So that in our figures, actually, making a better progress than we expected. So, it's making a very steady progress so far. In the net sales, like you see here, this is EBITDA, but this is before depreciation of Sprint, has been making a remarkable progress. That's something that you notice. Like I mentioned earlier, for many of you, that may feel that the SoftBank having a difficulty in Sprint, that you may see Sprint as a burden of SoftBank. But in me, in myself, actually, Sprint is going to be the rising star of SoftBank or is going to be the growing part of SoftBank. That's why I am so excited. EBITDA is also becoming better situation. So that the SoftBank has two values. One is something that we do, the management's operating asset. The other is the investment assets that we manage as a group companies. So, those two are our business portfolio. So investment assets, I say that it's not really the investment, but actually we are structuring the group companies. Most of the portfolios that we are the majority owner, and also involved in management, together with the management of the investee. So that's how we approach for these investment assets. First, let me go the overview of the operating assets. First is domestic telecom. There are some saying that we are hitting the ceiling or something like that. But actually, as you can tell from this chart, that we are making a steady increase one step by one step, to stable revenue trend. And by having an infrastructure of telecom that we'll be able to provide a lot of service on top of that. So we have a base of infrastructure. And on top of that, we'll be able to provide the services, which is something that's very SoftBank-like. And actually, as you can tell, the ARPU of main subscribers, this is revenue per month. Telecom revenue is flat or even a little bit of decreasing. But other than that, the service ARPU on top of the telecom ARPU is making a steady increasing. So, in total, compared to the quarter-to-quarter basis, it is very much stable trend. User wise it is increasing little by little, and at the same time management efficiency has been improving. So that's all the elements to make this grow. But also, we have one challenge in our mind, which is churn. For churn, we do have a room to improve further, and that we understand and we recognize. And the solution for that is here. It's the bundle service, home bundle discount. Those customers that if we only use the SoftBank telecom service, but if you also use the optical fiber or other service, those bundled service actually have the churn ratio is more than 50%. Therefore, we would like to also provide that the bundle service with the Denki Set Electricity and the Hikari Set, which is FTTH service. So those bundled with the mobile telecom is going to be provided. And this FTTH service, cumulative number of customers have been growing by 10 times. So, 120,000 have become 1.2 million now. So far, we have fixed-line, broadband, ADSL and we keep having running this business. But now that the migration from ADSL towards the optical fiber, if it is not profitable, it doesn't make sense. But now, we've been seeing that business model, which is profitable, and at the same time, migrating from the ADSL to the optical fiber. So that is now finalized. Therefore, now that we would like to increase the number of users steadily by steadily. So for the fixed-line broadband, ADSL and FTTH services, we have built the business model that is profitable. And now, we are seeing the good results of fixed broadband services, right. Compared to ADSL or cable service, FTTH service is more advanced. FTTH service, combined with high-speed wireless service. That combination is attractive to customers, and that could be a driving force of our growth. Now, we have built a great network. Speed-wise, we are number one and connectivity-wise, we are number one, but that is not fully understood by general public. Maybe we could do more about communicating that to general public, but according to data, our smartphone data connectivity is the best among the three carriers and also the speed is the fastest. I repeat. A lot of smartphone users, smart mobile phone users might have felt that there is connectivity issue about the SoftBank services, but not anymore. In the past, the people complained about that but not anymore. I go oversea trip every month, and every time I go on oversea trip, I feel that there is no other network in other countries which offer better network service than Japan. So, the Japan's network is the best, I guess. And we have built the best network in the world already. So, our CapEx spending on network peaked already. For the past four years or five years, we have aggressively spent on CapEx, especially on tower building, but we completed the building tower for base stations. So, our CapEx spending peaked. And as a result, the free cash flow started cumulating. Compared to the same period last year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 while the same period last year for the three quarters for 2014, the free cash flow was \\xc2\\xa53.6 billion, but this time, it's \\xc2\\xa5239.4 billion. This is the cash after tax. So, our free cash flow has been cumulating rapidly, and we can expect a similar growth trend in terms of free cash flow next year a lot. We are confident about that. So, in domestic telco business, the SoftBank will start cumulating free cash flow. And like I said earlier, there's a perception gap about the Sprint business between my perception and general public perception. So, let me talk about the Sprint. The Sprint, our net operating revenue bottomed or maybe it started turning around. The fixed cost was wasted in the past, in Sprint, in my view. But actually, not only myself but also Sprint management team members are acutely aware of the fact that Sprint had wasted fixed cost. When SoftBank acquired Vodafone's Japan unit, as a new owner of the company, the first job I worked on was to reduce the fixed cost and then attract customers with discounted prices, and then we launched iPhone to attract more customers. So, I took a three-phased approach with Vodafone Japan. Now, for the Sprint, again, the same approach was applied. The fixed cost reduction efforts are ongoing. What we looked at every single cost items to see how we could reduce the fixed cost. In the last time, I told you that 450 cost items were being reviewed. But actually, 750 cost items are being reviewed to reduce. This is not just a crunching numbers, but such cost reduction can be achieved by improving productivity and improving process efficiency. So, process change or a re-engineering of process is the key for fixed cost reduction efforts of Sprint, which is ongoing now. And as a result, the adjusted EBITDA increased steadily. So for the nine months up to December, the adjusted EBITDA increased by 41% from a year earlier. 41% increase of adjusted EBITDA While the Sprint share price is quite low right now, but when you look at the way they operate business, it's been improving dramatically in my view. And EBIT, it had been in the negative territory. The same period last year was $880 million negative, but this period, it was $302 million. It returned to a positive territory. That's a great progress for Sprint. And let me talk about four turnaround strategies. First of all, net additions improvement. Earlier, I said that the fixed cost needs to be reduced first. But we should not reduce cost at, by losing customers. But the Sprint is increasing net additions while decreasing cost. So far, the Sprint have been losing customers, net loss of customers, but the trend had reversed. It's been increasing net additions while cutting cost steadily. So, Sprint is now confident that they can do more about cost reduction because now they can acquire customers even though they are cutting cost. And the tablet is not the most profitable product. The smartphone, especially postpaid contracts, that's the most profitable business model. So postpaid smartphone is the mainstay product, and Sprint recorded net additions in postpaid smartphone customers. And that's a great progress for Sprint. And why net additions increased? Because churn rate decreased. Actually Sprint recorded the lowest third quarter churn rate in Sprint history. And net addition can be good net additions and bad net additions. Bad type of net addition is the net addition of subprime customers. They don't pay by acquiring subprime customers. The Sprint could increase customer base, but such customers would churn one year later or even a shorter period of time. So, when Marcelo Claure became CEO, he started tightening credit screening of customers. So, of course, he simplified the screening process, but he tried not to acquire subprime customers because the subprime customers will not contribute to profit making. So tried to make the better customer itself. As a result, six months later, we were able to reduce churn more and more. The other reason that we have been decreasing the churn is because of improvement of network. So with those two, as I mentioned, we've been able to improve churn, as a result, having a more net additions. So, we've been having a very good strategy here. And also, for the sales promotion plan, has been also showing a good result so far. So, customers, once, we have a net loss, but now we stopped that. And now having net additions, that's the first strategy, the first tactics. Second is the OpEx reduction. We have already reduced by $800 million, and that's been already achieved successfully. For it, in Japanese yen, it's \\xc2\\xa5100 billion level. And Sprint on a run rate basis, they would like to reduce by $2 billion. So it's going to be sustainable, and be able to reduce the fixed cost. So with those amounts that we've been looking at about $2 billion fixed cost reduction is now on the plan. And this is a breakdown of that $2 billion; sales, SG&A or the cost of service, cost of products. So, in total, we are looking at $2 billion of fixed cost is going to be reduced. So under such a circumstance, why sort of Sprint share price is still going down? I think there are two reasons. One, can Sprint really achieve cost reduction? Can Sprint really stop the net loss and start showing more profitability? There are still some skepticism about the Sprint results. That's half of the market I believe, and the remaining half is concerned about the cash of Sprint, the cash moneys of Sprint, I would say. They have a bond redemption end of this year and the end of next year that they will be having a maturity due of the bond redemption. And there are some concerns that can we really pay those that back? I understand your concern. But, of course, we have already addressed those issues. For the bond redemption amount, as you can see here, year 2016 is this amount. But resource to pay that, we have a liquidity, cash and cash equivalents and also the variety of the approach and options that we are prepared. So that we have diverse financing methods, which includes all of these so that we have schedule to repay bonds. That's why I have so confident. And the last one, which is the real or the core part that when we look at the mid-term to long-term. This is going to be the most important part to be improved, which is the network. A year ago or two years ago, churn was really high in Sprint. And the main reason, why was the network? Connectivity was not good. Transaction is so in the way we've been spending CapEx for about two years and being improving the networks. Therefore, now, I'm happy to say that Sprint network is now showing the clear signs of the progress. As you can see on this chart, that this is the collection speed. Now that Sprint is showing number one position. This is the download delivered speed. Most of the customers are using smartphones, and it's been used in daily rate. So, especially in the United States, speed is very slow for the smartphones. They always see those waiting signs, and you cannot get connection. So that those are the cases that you often see. But now, Sprint is constantly showing the number one position. This is the Nielsen survey, this is a third party. So, Nielsen is also measuring the TV rates. So, the third-party survey and one of the most famous company is showing the survey results. And here that we've been keeping the number one position in several times already constantly. And also for the voice. Sometimes during the call, you may lose the call. You have a drop call. Now that we have reduced the drop call rate from 0.9% in year ago and that has been reduced by half, which is currently 0.4%. So, 0.4% compared to the competitors, this is quite good. So that's how we have been able to improve so far. And the other elements, another survey company, RootMetrics. Here, again, Sprint awards that they're receiving has reached 212 from 51. So that mobile phone service, I believe this is the biggest or largest, most awards ever in Sprint history. Also, we have internal surveys of Sprint service data connection. Even looking at a nationwide comparison, they are having a number two position in our internal survey. Especially, New York and Chicago is showing a very good situation like number one position means that Sprint network finally, finally showing the results of improvement. The biggest highlight is network. Mobile phones is almost the same now amongst the competitors. Every company sell Samsung Galaxy, iPhones and everything. So that it's almost similar lineup. So the biggest highlight is the network itself. So whilst network is now coming to number one, number two position in Sprint, are we satisfied? No, because I do understand, I do know that SoftBank's situation in Japan, so that compared to that, still, even that they're number one and number two, but still the quality is still to be improved in United States. Therefore me, myself, became Chief Network Officer. So, actually, I volunteered myself. And making a decision, me appointing myself, and now involved heavily in designing of network in operations almost every day, starting from 10 o'clock to 1 AM or 2 AM that we have discussion with SoftBank engineers and Sprint engineers. Regardless of weekends or holidays that almost every day, we are having a very detailed discussion in network designs. But actually, this is something that's so exciting. This morning, actually, we had the same call last night. We had a call, but it's like my hobby. It is so exciting. And I am now just seeing a more better picture of network. And I am having so much fun. I am so sure that the Sprint network is going to be number one in the United States. It's going to be absolutely number one. That's something that I am so confident, and I see a clear picture of that. So that's why that I am so confident. So this is something that so much that I can proceed. So, as a summary, four keys for turnaround. This is a basic strategy for the turnaround. Net addition improvement, first of all; and OpEx reduction, second of all; and diverse financing methods; and last but not least, network improvement. So with those four elements, in each that I have a confidence even more every day. I'm not bragging or anything. A year ago, as you remember, a year ago today, I was so honest about myself. I said it's going to be a long journey. That's so honest of me that I told you that we are going to be spending a very long journey with Sprint. And also, having a lot of question from you, and I said that it's going to be long journey to battle. So last year now that I was almost thinking that we were going to sell Sprint. So, the earnings of three months before that I mentioned, the same thing, but there was no buyer. So, I have no choice. But because we couldn't do the merger with T-Mobile, which was original schedule. And that didn't came true, so, for that, we have no choice but to sell. But because there was no buyer, so that's why we have to divide our self to improve the company. So that we have now have a full efforts into the turnaround. So no excuse, but myself to be involved so directly, I have a hands-on operations here. And now that I am so, no excuse, but I am fully involved. And I have a very \\xe2\\x80\\x93 committed myself. And now that I have a very clear view of the solutions in the turnaround, that's something that I wanted to report to you today. So, Sprint announced the other day that it has revised their guidance upward for the full-year 2015 from original $6.8 billion to $7.1 billion, to $7.7 billion to $8 billion range. And also it announced the forecast of a positive operating income for 2016. So, Sprint grows confidence about the increasing trends of EBITDA. About \\xc2\\xa51 trillion worth of adjusted EBITDA could be achievable in 2016. So that's about Sprint. I spent much of my time. So, let me move on to Yahoo! Japan. Yahoo! Japan is a listed company. So, you may have known about the Yahoo! Japan. About Search Ads revenue, it's been on a decreasing trend because of the shift from PC to mobile phones. And usually, for the mobile phones, the Google is pre-installed and also their screen size is small in the smartphone compared to PC. So, search ads revenue has been decreasing, but that decrease is offset by Display Ad revenue, why? Because even with the smaller smartphone screen than PC screen, the so-called in-feed advertisement, like the one available in Facebook, that is working very well. So, depending on the user's profile, for example, a 17-year-old high school girl, if you show the advertisement of Mercedes Benz luxurious car for a 17-year old high school girl, it doesn't work. And if you promote \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so, but instead, any advertisement of product or services that a high school girl would be interested or feel compelled to buy, then that's what advertiser want to do. And so, such are the system for advertisers are offered, as through the Yahoo! Display Ad network service. Next, shopping transaction values. Two years ago, the Yahoo! Japan declared the start of e-commerce revolution. And Yahoo! Japan emulate or adopted the Alibaba-type e-commerce business model. Since the change of e-commerce business model of two years ago, the growth rate of shopping transaction value increased. Two years ago, the value growth rate was 3%; the last year, 12%; and this year, 48%. That's, by far, the largest increase in transaction value among Japanese companies. Yahoo! Japan's major competitor, I don't say the name, but even compared to the biggest label or competitor of Yahoo! Japan, the Yahoo! Japan shopping transaction value growth rate is by far the larger. And then Yahoo! announced the acquisition of Ikyu Corporation, and the TOB completed already. So, I think you can imagine that the Yahoo! Japan could grow further. Next, all others, Pepper. It's been selling well. Actually, it sold out in just one minute for the past seven consecutive months. So, once we released within one month, it's sold out. And we are going to sell Pepper at SoftBank shops. And Pepper for Biz, a lot more than expected number of companies want to introduce Pepper in their business. So the Pepper business site is still small, but we see growth potential in Pepper business. So, let me move on to investment assets, also another business portfolio. First of all, e-commerce. Alibaba is the biggest. Alibaba's gross merchandise volume hit \\xc2\\xa557 trillion. This is just for first nine months of this fiscal year. That's a huge enormous amount just for nine months. \\xc2\\xa557 trillion of gross merchandise volume. And that led to a total revenue of \\xc2\\xa5668.2 billion, which is 32% year-on-year increase. And worthy of note is that mobile transaction volume grew rapidly. Actually, it grew three times from last year. So the mobile transaction volume will be more than half in the near future. People afraid that once the shift from the PC to mobile would lead to the decrease in revenue, but actually it doesn't happen. The mobile sales has been increasing. And non-GAAP net income has been increasing. The China risk is a bad word. Recently, a lot of people talk about China risk. And the China's GDP growth rate is 6.9%, but some people say that it should be 5% or below 6%, but actually still the China's GDP growth rate is much higher than that of Japan or United States and others. And compared to the China's GDP, the China's retail business has been growing late of 10%. And among them, e-commerce has been growing 20%. So, the China GDP is bigger than that of Japan. And, of course, a lot of people are worried about China's economic slowdown, but actually, China's GDP has been growing and retail business in China has been growing as well. And among them, the e-commerce has been growing steadily. And Alibaba's revenue or net income is much larger than that of Amazon or other major retailers in the world. Alibaba's revenue, transaction volume and net income is by far largest in the world. Next, India Snapdeal, the gross sales increased 90% year-over-year. Coupang in South Korea, it increased 4 times from year-over-year. Indonesia Tokopedia, the gross merchandise volume increased 3 times. And OYO has become the largest hotel-booking site in India. The founder is very young, 21-year-old or 22-year-old. He started his business at age of 19. And the used room night increased 34 times from a year earlier. The largest company in the world, which is not listed, is Uber. And Ola is the Indian equivalent of Uber. And its market share is 80%, and its quarterly bookings increased tenfold year-over-year. And GrabTaxi, which is prevalent in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. The quarterly bookings grew 6 times year-over-year. And in China, the KuaiDi Taxi has more than 90% market share. And number-wise, it's far bigger than that of Uber total. So SoftBank Group company's transportation services are available only in Asia, but the total number of rides only in Asia is larger than the total number of rides delivered by Uber in the world. And all these companies are not listed yet, but we see a huge growth potential in those companies, they're not listed yet. In the past, before Alibaba IPO, no matter how many times I talk about the value of Alibaba, people didn't understand the value of Alibaba. But after the IPO, Alibaba's value become evident. So, digitalizing the value has not yet been ready for this company, but I am so excited about this company. And also, games, but growth-wise it's not that much compared to before but still making a steady profit and still also making the most profitable gaming company in Japan, Supercell, is the most profitable company in the world. So those are also the SoftBank Group companies. FinTech. Now that I frequently hear that word you hear, but compared to the last year, the funded amount is four times now. So, FinTech's most promising company, but unlisted is SoFi, I believe. SoFi, the loan volume, the funded amount has already exceed $5 billion so that making a rapid growth, 4 times. So it's a great business model. I could spend about three hours to talk about this company itself, but I would like to cut it here. So that now we are making a very steady progress in operating asset as well as investment assets. And also, group companies, portfolio companies, they're also making a very steady progress. So, in both way that we are so excited about it. And lastly, this is my old days, young days. This is the old picture of mine. You see more hair. It's long days ago. But every day back then we were so passionate about addressing the management challenge. It's about the same thing here that what's doing right now. So, anytime that we see the challenge and we see any problem that my brain starts working. I have more passion. I have more energy. In that time, I am so fulfilled. And when I, actually, hands on to the company, and when I'm involved directly to the management, there are many, but these are the typical examples. So, my pride is that I personally involved and focused to turn around and I never failed in the past. So that's my pride. I am so proud of myself that I've been making the turnaround successful when I'm personally involved. Actually, Yahoo! Japan make a profit before Yahoo! U.S. make a profit. Back then, the Yahoo! Inc. was ups and downs. But back then, we have already seen the increase of profit in Yahoo! Japan. In the fixed-line business, we have acquired the Japan Telecom. Most of the fixed-line telecom operators in the world was facing the negative numbers or decreasing in profit. But, actually, they are falling down, but actually we have able make turnarounds happen and put it into positive, SoftBank Mobile as well. Back then, the Vodafone was dropping in profitability, but once that I had my personal involvement, has been making a turnaround. So, this is my pride and this is my achievement. I am so proud of it. And that, you can see, Sprint, with my pride, I would like to do the same. I would like to make this turnaround happen once again. Year ago, I lost my confidence. I wanted to sell. I wanted to find a buyer. But now, no excuse but we're going to make this happen. We're going to make this turnaround. And I have so confident in myself to make that happen. I am talking too much, but that's how I feel. I'm so passionate, and I am so honest about myself. And I am so confident in myself. So, that's something I wanted to tell you honestly today, and that concludes my presentation. Thank you very much. \",\n",
       " '2015 Q4': \"My name is Son from SoftBank. So managing a company, running a company, running business, there are lots of difficulties ahead, but sometimes very exciting and very meaningful. That's what I feel. And under such circumstance, especially these days, myself has been focusing and spending a lot of time to turnaround the business of Sprint. And fortunately, we've been able to improve the network Sprint quite heavily and at the same time operational cost of Sprint has been reduced largely. And on top of that, about 1,000 item for the cost reduction initiatives have been launched. And we've been implementing one by one and contributing to the cost reduction overall. To make the cost reduction, it's not only the guts to do or it's not only to cut the budget, but actually you have to review throughout the business process so that you will be able to avoid any risk or you will be able to make it more efficient. So by cumulating those efforts one by one and now that you're seeing those in numbers these days. And in the past one year, I believe we've been making quite a good progress so far and also coming one year that we would like to make a steady improvement going forward, and we are very much confident to make that happen. So from the [indiscernible] (03:49) have a one new agenda, then you think about it more seriously. And if you think about it seriously, then you have more strong confidence once you achieve that to overcome those. That's how I feel these days especially. Now, let me go into the presentation. Consolidated results. As you can see, net sales, 8% increase; adjusted EBITDA, 19% increase; EBIT, 9%; net income, minus 29%, however, this is because last year Alibaba went IPO. And this Alibaba IPO, if it happens every year, that's good, but it's not for this fiscal year and there was no such big IPO this fiscal year. Therefore we have a negative figure for net income. But if we exclude this one-time gain from Alibaba IPO, effective the net income actually increased by 23%. That's the results for this fiscal year. So let me go one by one. Net sales, as you see, each segment is making quite a good progress. And adjusted EBITDA, in overseas, this EBITDA is the very important KPI for the business measurement, and this has increased by 19% to \\xc2\\xa52.4 trillion. And also in this graph, as you can see, Sprint made the best contribution to the increase of adjusted EBITDA. In net income, of course, still Sprint is in red. However, as you can see from this graph and as you can tell that operating income before depreciation, Sprint has improved largely in the business. EBIT. Domestic Telecom. Yahoo making good steady progress. And this yellow line is under IFRS EBIT. Total line is the U.S. GAAP Sprint EBIT. What's difference? In SoftBank, we adapt IFRS for the accounting procedures and that has been so for several years. When we acquired Sprint, there was a company like Clearwire which we've calculated book value, and at the time of acquisition we have depreciated, which has been made more conservatively. Under the U.S. GAAP, Sprint has continuously running the business so that there was a difference of the measurement of calculation, but either way Sprint running a business in United States. In EBIT, this is first time in positive in nine years or so, which is a very happy news for Sprint. Under IFRS, it's more positive in EBIT. That's the total picture. Now let me go into details. Domestic Telecom, first of all. EBIT is progressing continuously, 7% increase year-over-year. Our sales is making quite a good trend. ARPU, this again keep good trend, especially service ARPU is making growth. And here on how can we maintain the stable growth? And a big portion is SoftBank Hikari fiber-to-the-home service is becoming a driver for the growth. We said it is ADSL \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have the most expensive and the slowest speed back then, but actually back then that we have realized the situation why that we have the fastest and cheapest in ADSL, but actually era has changed. And now we are going into fiber era from ADSL. And actually, fiber business was not in a structure where we can earn the profit. And it was difficult for the approach to the market. However, now we are seeing good profitability and also business plan and business model has been established. Therefore, in the past one year that we've been aggressively pushing this service, as a result we've been seeing good achievements which will be the base for SoftBank Mobile to expand continuously. And also, differentiation by content is another thing. Sports programs, especially professional baseball is the most popular content and also have the biggest audience. Out of the 12 baseball team, 10 teams including SoftBank HAWKS games can be live broadcasted to SoftBank smartphones. I myself is the user of this service. Almost every night I watch the new sports program. Even when I am abroad, I'm in overseas; I watch sport \\xe2\\x80\\x93 SoftBank HAWKS baseball games. So I really appreciate the value of the Sportsnavi LIVE program. As long as I have iPad with me on overseas trip, I can watch the baseball games of Japanese \\xe2\\x80\\x93 baseball \\xe2\\x80\\x93 professional baseball teams, while I am eating dinner and so on. And I believe that this kind of content will help SoftBank to differentiate itself from other companies in content market. But the core service of SoftBank is network and connectivity. We made a lot of efforts to improve the data connectivity and as a result of all these efforts, our network provides the best connectivity in Japan. From time-to-time I go overseas trip on business, and I experienced network connectivity of other countries. And based on my experience, I can say it confidently that the Sprint \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, SoftBank's network is the best in the world. When I am in Europe, I don't think the connectivity is good and also in United States, although one of my group company is running wireless business in United States, but I'd say that the connectivity in United States is far from good. Yet at Japan, you can find the most advanced smartphone network in the world. And out of that, the SoftBank is by far the number one in terms of data connectivity as well as download speed. For the past years, we spent heavily on our network facilities. We have built towers for base stations and we installed network equipment for improved network coverage and connectivities. Now we peaked our CapEx spending on network, as a result we can free up cash, so we can generate free cash flow constantly from now on about the level of \\xc2\\xa5400 billion or even bigger. Free cash flow relative to revenue is high when it comes to SoftBank. In \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think the SoftBank is one of the best companies in the world in terms of the free cash flow relative to revenue. So that's about Domestic Telecom business. Now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 next, I would like to talk about Sprint which people say is the biggest headache of SoftBank. But so far we are running our strategies for turnaround and we concentrated our efforts on those -implementing strategies. And those are the strategies; net addition improvements, revenue stabilization, OpEx reduction, diverse financing methods, and network improvements. Now, first of all, the customer acquisition. Until last year, the Sprint kept losing customers, but finally the Sprint recorded net additions of customers. In particular, they recorded net additions of postpaid phone customers. The prepaid service is not really profitable and tablets is not very profitable either. The postpaid phone customers have bring about a large revenue \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually our postpaid phone customers bring about 90% of the revenue or income of Sprint. And for the first time in many years, the postpaid phone customers recorded net addition. And so far, Sprint really surpassed Verizon and AT&T in terms of net additions. But for the first time on the company record, the Sprint has surpassed Verizon and AT&T in terms of net additions of postpaid phone customers. Of course T-Mobile is producing respectable results and we should be aware that we should do more so that our Sprint could catch up with T-Mobile. But so far until last year the Sprint was far behind Verizon and AT&T, but the Sprint finally surpassed Verizon and AT&T, and that's one of the fact that proves that the Sprint efforts are producing results. And you can see the good result in churn. So far that's high Sprint's churn rate, it was bit driven by the poor network service. That was the biggest reason behind customers' termination of contract. But now, I am Chief Network Officer of Sprint. CEO is, as you know, Marcelo and I report to Marcelo as a Chief Network Officer. And I take hands-on approach in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and working on with our Sprint engineering team directly. And almost every night I join a conference call to check the progress of network team's work. Every day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 every nights at 11:00 P.M. Japan time, I make phone call to Sprint's engineering team and also I check on all the data metrics. Now I see the improvements in Sprint network every day and that resulted in lower churn rate. Of course, in the past, Sprint's churn rate was too high so that's why all these effort is paying to reduce churn rate that dramatically. So revenue have bottomed out and started increasing. So far, the Sprint offered devices free of charge or offered fat discount to customers to earn income out of mobile phone charge. That was the business model, but the Sprint started to offer device for a charge by way of installments program. And that way the Sprint can earn the device charge from customers. And as a result, the Sprint can stabilize the revenue from customers or revenue per account, and that resulted in the increase of revenue. But that said, we are not seeing the dramatic increase in revenue. Revenue will be leveling off, but what I'd like to emphasize here is that to improve the profit what is important is to reduce cost. When a company is losing income to the extent it is on the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it being on the verge of bankrupt, then that company is spending heavily or spending too much on expenses. So cost reduction will be the right way to improve profitability of customers. It's really hard to increase revenues or sales dramatically. So in order for companies to return around its business, the first thing it needs to do is to reduce cost and Sprint is facing squarely with cost reduction challenge. And so far the Sprint successfully reduced about \\xc2\\xa5150 billion of costs for the past year. As a result, the Sprint adjusted EBITDA was this. It increased by $2 billion year-over-year. And that's a big progress made by Sprint. And here is EBIT. Under U.S. GAAP, the Sprint kept recording negative EBIT, and even I started worrying about the potential bankruptcy of Sprint. But for the first time in nine years, the Sprint recorded positive EBIT. So nine years it's been in red and didn't bankrupt even that's how I think. But now that the first time in nine years it became positive. It's $300 million, it's not bad in EBIT in positive. So the improvement-wide, it's \\xc2\\xa5200 billion. So the EBIT turnaround by \\xc2\\xa5200 billion is not bad at all. And next, which has been focused was the liquidity that the money may be short, that has been concerned by the market. And that's why we've been also putting every effort. So that as a result, liquidity for Sprint is now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have enough or abundant liquidity sustained so that for the cash management you made a wrong decision on business, but those kind of things does not happening because so far \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because of the running out of money, that's why that you may have to buy expensive thing or you may have to buy in cash or in sales, sometimes you have to stretch, but those kind of things happen because of the money short. But now that you have money abundant, then that you will be able to have more attention to cost reductions and everything. As a result, network CapEx in the meantime after SoftBank acquisition, network CapEx has been made. Positively churn has decreased, because network improvement was the main reason. And this is the survey result from Nielsen. It's not by us, but a third party Nielsen. This is a famous company to check the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 watching ratios and now speed ratio has been done nationwide. And as a result, nationwide connection speed are showing Sprint number one, Verizon number two, AT&T number three, and T-Mobile number four. So these are the result that are showing by Nielsen. These [ph] stays (23:25) not only nationwide, but also the major markets such as New York, Chicago, Houston. Here in those major market now that the Sprint is maintaining number one or number two. Even though we have such a result, but still not being recognized by the market. People may say that this is still lie or they don't believe in us. But actually, SoftBank network was also like the same situation. Many people thought that SoftBank network is not having a good connection. Even Twitter, that they are complaining and I have been told by many people that the SoftBank has a difficulty in connectivity and that's why that I have to make this happen. We have to turn around, but still difficult to get the good recognition by the market. I think same thing happens to Sprint. But in reality, as you can see from the result from the scientific analysis, now that the Sprint has been improving for sure. So churn decreasing, expense decreasing. As a result, this year EBITDA that we can increase to the size \\xe2\\x80\\x93 level of \\xc2\\xa5200 billion level, that's something that we are expecting. That's something that announced by Sprint as guidance. Last \\xe2\\x80\\x93 past one year, about \\xc2\\xa5200 billion level of improvement has done on top of that additional \\xc2\\xa5200 billion, so in two years \\xc2\\xa5400 billion operational improvement. EBITDA, that operating income before depreciation over two years topped \\xc2\\xa5400 billion of improvement. It's easy to say, but really difficult to make that happen. It's not easy at all. That's something that we'd like to do in Sprint. Up until then that it was negative or flat, but in the past two years, it's been making a remarkable improvement as we can see from the graph and also that the expectation or forecast can be announced with confidence. That's the kind of level that we are in Sprint. Of course, you'll see the result later on. A year later that you will see the result and we have to achieve that and we need to validate that, and we do have our accountability to execute that. But last year, January, February and March, I was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said it's a long way to go. It's a long tunnel and the long suffer. We haven't seen the end yet. That was my honest opinion, honest comment back then. So I said it's a long way to go to turn the Sprint around because the idea of the T-Mobile merger has been cancelled. And I say it's going to be very long way to go, but now we gained confidence back and we are making a steady improvement and expecting \\xc2\\xa5400 billion level of the improvement in EBITDA which is a big, big progress. And I hope that you can appreciate that a little bit. At SoftBank Mobile, we had a difficult time as well. You can remember, in the beginning, operating income was dropping sharply and we made a V-shape recovery from there. Sprint is now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sorry, SoftBank Mobile is now generating quite a big free cash flow. Wanted to keep attention \\xe2\\x80\\x93 pay attention to Sprint, you'll see the V-shape recovery. Once again, we would like to make it happen once again and we are very determined to do so. And now you see the sign from those announcements in presentation. So Sprint, as their official guidance shows in here; adjusted EBITDA 9.5 billion to 10 billion, operating income 1 billion to 1.5 billion. It's close to \\xc2\\xa5100 billion to \\xc2\\xa5160 billion. Cash CapEx, $3 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, it's been negative, more debts over and over but now it's becoming a reducing of debt. That's the kind of a phase we are facing and we are prepared for that. That's the Sprint. I believe that there are many way that you see Sprint and your comment on SoftBank. And always, I see the comments that SoftBank is suffering in Sprint or SoftBank is having a difficulty in overseas. That's like a template but I wanted to see one years later. You may want to change your headlines now and you may feel that you would like to change your opinions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 oh, thank you very much. So a year later that's the situation you see. You yourself is going to be confident. Now that I am confident and I am talking about it loudly, but year later, you yourself, you'll be confident. You will be motivated to write a better story in SoftBank. Now that the Yahoo!, Yahoo! Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Yahoo! US I think US now, they are negative, suffering, that's the situation that they are experiencing a few years. It happened to be a same brand, but Yahoo! Japan situation, since its foundation it never fail to decrease in operating income. Actually Yahoo! Japan turned positive earlier than Yahoo! Inc. in United States. Since the service launch in the first months they became positive. Before Yahoo! Inc. in United States become positive, Yahoo! Japan was positive. And actually Yahoo! Inc. was suffering for the reduction of revenue and so far but never to fail to reduce. What is different then under the same brand? They first start with the same business model, what's different? One is controlled by Soft \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one is parent by SoftBank, the other one is not parented by SoftBank. That's the only difference in between those two. What else do you see the difference? That's something that I would like to say. I wanted to say that. That's Yahoo! Japan. Don't worry about it. It is making a steady growth under the same brand it's totally different in Yahoo! Japan. Yahoo! Japan over Search ads service, but now their focus is now on smartphone, not PC. And \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but smartphones market is dominated by android or Google, which always embedded \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has embedded Google. So, usually the search is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for search engine, the users use Google. So people predicted that once more and more people start using smartphone over the PC, that Yahoo! Japan will lose income because Yahoo! Japan's Search ads is optimized \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was more suitable for PC. But as customers' traffic is shifting from PCs to smartphone, still the Yahoo! Japan's search share arm is increasing in the smartphone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 among the smartphone users. Of course, the Google search engine is embedded by default, but among the Japanese users, the users choose Yahoo! Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Yahoo!'s search engine. They prefer Yahoo! search engine over Google search engine and that's the Yahoo! Japan's search share among the smartphone users in Japan has been increasing. That's a [ph] good (32:35) trend. And also, the Display ads revenue is increasing. Again, the customers are shifting from PCs to smartphone. And of course, the screen of smartphone is smaller than PCs, so the effectiveness of ads on smartphone will be small \\xe2\\x80\\x93 smaller than PCs and thus the ads revenue wouldn't increase, that's what many people believed in the past. But actually Yahoo! Japan started introducing the in-feed ad as a part of display ad. So even when customers are scroll down the screen, then that's in-feed ad stay on the screens. So it's not embedded as a part of content. And that's how the in-feed ad works. And because of that in-feed ad, the effectiveness of advertisement increased, and so the price for display ad. And because of that the Display Ad revenue has been increasing. Now, profitability wise, the Search Ad, when it comes to search Ads, Yahoo! Japan needs to pay the royalty to Google, but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and so on. But for Display Ad, if the Yahoo! Japan run the Display Ad on its own, the income or ads fee would go to Yahoo! Japan only, 100%. So there is no royalty involved. So profitability wise, the Display Ad is higher than Search ads and the share of Display Ad in Yahoo!'s revenue is increasing and thus profitability in advertising business of Yahoo! Japan has been improving. And next, e-Commerce. Yahoo! Inc. doesn't run e-Commerce business. They don't offer a shopping service. But Yahoo! Japan is running shopping business. And in the past Yahoo! Japan was far behind Rakuten or Amazon, and I felt frustrated about that but for the past two years Yahoo! Japan has changed its e-Commerce model to that of Alibaba's. And after that change to the Alibaba model, Yahoo!'s e-Commerce has been growing at the fastest rate in Japan. Among all these key players, especially compared to Rakuten and Amazon, Yahoo! Japan's shopping transaction value is growing faster. Actually a 62% growth rate was recorded. Of course they made upfront investments, so income from shopping business is still low, but actually the income level has been improving dramatically. So ad business has adopted better business model and shopping business is also growing fast. And then also the Yahoo! Japan are started \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are focusing on payment services and other services, and new services are also launched, so I'm placing a high expectation on Yahoo!. So that's about it for operating assets, the Domestic Telecom, the Sprint, Yahoo! Japan. So from now on I'd like to talk about another engine of business. Well, one of the engine is the operating assets which we control and run business. The other one is investment assets. We have an investment portfolio, hence we form partnership with entrepreneurs. As a strategic partner of such entrepreneurs, we help them grow their business. Now, we see a big opportunity now. Why? Well, because there are a lot of world-class entrepreneurs in emerging markets. In the past you could find entrepreneurs only in Silicon Valley, and of course, then the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you started finding entrepreneurs in Japan, and they move on to China and India. So the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in many places around the world we are seeing the next Jack Ma emerging. And of course new business models are emerging that are enabled by mobile and cloud. In IT infrastructure and AI and new technologies, or the evolution in technologies, taking account of all, we can see a huge opportunity. And from investor standpoint, well, they say that the Chinese stock market are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is falling, or that there are a lot of troubles in European markets and also the Japan stock market as well as ForEx markets are showing a bleak prospect. So the investor sentiment is on a downward trend, but that poses great opportunity for us, because SoftBank has a history of active investment in new companies about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in IT bubble burst around 2000. Of course because of such investment the SoftBank suffered a lot of losses. But at that time I was the only person who said that this was the golden opportunity for us to make investments. And people criticized me that I didn't learn any lesson from the IT bubble burst. But looking back, around 2000, after IT bubble burst that could have been the best opportunity for us to make investment actively. So recently, the investor sentiments are swaying over their decision on investment. But actually the market for investment is growing, especially in Asia. And I see a huge opportunity in Asia. And so we are facing the great opportunity for investment now. So we always invest with convictions, at scale and we try to be the long-term partner of industries, and also we have favorable access to capital. We have \\xc2\\xa52 trillion worth of cash and equivalents and of course we have a lot of stakes in public companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 private companies. And also we have global perspective and when we select investees, we always think about the operational value-add to our existing business. And we announced that SoftBank new 2.0 and we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now we have Nikesh Arora in our management team. And we are very fortunate that we have Nikesh now. So, the SoftBank is going to be world-class company. So far what we did was like a practice. We are warming up and we are going to make a full-fledged effort on investment. So I'd like to give you some update on our investment portfolio. First of all, e-Commerce sector. Alibaba as you know. Finally, Alibaba surpassed the world's biggest retailer Walmart in terms of gross merchandize volume. Yes, finally Alibaba surpassed Walmart. In the past several years history, it's been number one and this is a first time exceeded. Walmart reaches Alibaba. And actually there are almost only in China and that exceed the global Walmart. And you can see the growth ratio here. Actually Walmart is flat. Alibaba is actually still grazing there. And advertisement revenue or the commissions also increasing; it's \\xc2\\xa52 trillion in Japanese yen. Actually \\xc2\\xa550 trillion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xc2\\xa560 trillion of the GMV, \\xc2\\xa550 trillion, \\xc2\\xa560 trillion, and actually making a 30% of increase in annual. So annually \\xc2\\xa515 trillion of GMV increasing, is there any such company around there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 out there? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Actually much larger than Amazon, much better revenue, better GMV, better growth. Why market cap is less on Amazon? That's the question. You \\xe2\\x80\\x93 want you to think about it once again. Maybe this is the time. Mobile revenue also increasing dramatically. E-commerce mobile with the small display in smartphone, can you buy things? Maybe you questioned in the past, but Alibaba show you the answer. Became smartphone transaction actually increased even further. Smartphone growth ratio is bigger. Net income compare with Amazon, actually uncomparable. Maybe Alibaba is not very good at IR or the other is too good. I don't know. You may see other lots of angles, but I think this is because \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think that we have more value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 personally thinking that the Alibaba has more value than Amazon. Of course, they evaluated by \\xe2\\x80\\x93 should be evaluate by market. But you see the result 10 years later, 20 years later. Which is better, which is bigger is not really the matter. Is it Amazon or is it Alibaba? But both are making growth, actually much better than Walmart. Both actually becoming a very valuable company, that's for sure. And now Amazon in United States, we are only doing Alibaba in China. Actually history will repeat. In India, there are almost a similar populations as China. In the 10 years ahead, 20 years ahead India is going to make a dramatical growth. That's how I believe. Ten years ago, 15 years ago, I was saying that it's going to be the China. And the many people in the world, he doesn't understand what he's talking about. So that the people question about my saying, but you already know the result, right. I myself now say that the same growth is going to be happening in India from now. In e-Commerce in India actually growing 90% which is Snapdeal. It's Alibaba in India, which is Snapdeal. So we have found in early stage and we become the major \\xe2\\x80\\x93 majority shareholder, which is very good for us. Then in Korea, growing 300%; e-Commerce in Korea becoming number one, making a rapid growth. Coupang is also very exciting company. Indonesia, Tokopedia; this again is making growth, like 254%. It's not 2.5 times; it's 254% increase. So it's about 3.5 times I say or even more. The biggest hotel chain \\xe2\\x80\\x93 became the biggest hotel chain in India which is Oyo, the biggest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 years old founder. He's now 29, right? 22. So he became 22 now. So he established the company business in year of 19 and in three years it became the biggest hotel chain in India. He doesn't own hotel, only putting the brand of Oyo under the Oyo brand and using mobile phone provide a booking assistance for customer and also check-out. So that Oyo now became the biggest hotel chain in India, which is another exciting company. So up to here is the e-Commerce. Now let's go into transportation. Unlisted company and the biggest valuation is by Uber. Uber, using internet changed the business model. Those taxi drivers who are the individual business or the mid to small sized company providing 100 to 200 cars for the taxi company, that's another thing. But to get the customer, you have to just drive around and find a customer. Or you stay at the road, wait until customer comes in. That was a situation in the taxi world. But taking advantage of internet you obtain the customer, you acquire the customer and they [ph] debit the (47:33) car. That was the business model that they introduced, and making a dramatic increase. It's unlisted but already 60 billion type of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it's like a \\xc2\\xa56 trillion or \\xc2\\xa57 trillion valuation that they are gaining. And our group company, Ola, it's now number one in India, Uber-like company. And expected arrival time became half. So if you ask the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for car, and the waiting time for the car became half. That's how you can see, the many cars are now registered to Ola. So, network is expanding and growing. Another thing is the GrabTaxi in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand; so Southeast Asia are same model, GrabTaxi. This company too, year-over-year five times. And in China the rides \\xe2\\x80\\x93 number of rides only in China already exceed the number of world Uber numbers treated equally. So 20 times year-over-year. So it's growing tremendously. So we are seeing and expecting the big future growth. So we have a company who exceeds Uber only in China. So even in India it's the biggest. In Southeast Asia it's number one transportation company. It's all under the SoftBank Group. So our Group have already exceeded the number of rides compared to Uber's numbers. So this is a Transportation, and now to Games and Media. So when it comes to smartphone, game has changed. Up until then Xbox, Nintendo, PlayStation by Sony, but when it comes to smartphone, smartphone game company is going to be growing more in terms of number of users, in terms of revenue. That's what I said two years ago or the four years ago. Only \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and then we made a investment into to two companies in smartphone; one became number one in Japan, the other one became number one in the world. So only we invest in two companies, number one in Japan, number one in world. Not bad at all, is it? I think many company may invest in many companies, but our track record of investment in internet companies is actually showing IRR of 40-some percent. In annual average we are growing 40-some percent. Have you seen such a venture capital? Have you seen any private equity company in the world, especially with this size? No such company. That's something that I wanted to recognize once again. These days when you see a SoftBank, you may feel it's boring anymore or you think that we are suffering in Sprint. That's the only image for SoftBank in the market. But actually we are the biggest investment return. We have a capabilities like a venture capital, private equity, that's actually growing more and actually made another launch in SoftBank 2.0. That's something that I wanted to remind you once again. Supercell, well, so far the Clash of Clans was number one game in the world. And let \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the new game was released in March and that new game, Clash Royale became number one immediately. So Supercell released only four game titles, but every one of them became number one or two or \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and in the top ranking, joined the top-rank in our games. And GungHo is also producing a good result. So that's it for games. And this is messenger, our business. This is like Line of Japan. And Hike messenger became number two in the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Indian market. And we have 40-some percent stake in this company. Next, FinTech. The fastest growing FinTech is this, SoFi and we are the largest shareholder of SoFi. Our operating company, especially SoftBank offer Domestic Telecom business and the Sprint in United States. They are showing a good progress and Yahoo! Japan consistently growing her profit. And then we have our investment portfolio and all of these investees are generating good track record. And so we recently announced the share buyback. As a result of share buyback, number of shares in market, our shares decreased. So we decided to keep the total amount of dividend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 amount allocated for dividend payment that the number of shares decreased and thus the dividend per share increased. And that's what we announced at other day. So let me drop up. So Domestic Telco is generating free cash flow at the level of \\xc2\\xa5400 billion or \\xc2\\xa5500 billion, and this is not just a one-time event. And the Sprint is turning around. The turnaround strategy is making progress. And our investment strategy is on track. So we will see a further growth in our business portfolio and I like to promise that we will work harder toward future growth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 further growth. Thank you for your attention. Now we'd like to open the floor for questions.\",\n",
       " '2016 Q1': \"My name is Son. Thank you very much for joining today. So, life is very interesting, you never know. This time recently, we have just announced regarding the intention of acquisition of ARM. And regarding this project, the first time I proposed to the Chairman of ARM was at Turkey, right after the terrorist event happened. And right after that, when we had discussion at Turkey, there is a Coups d'etat at the Turkey. And that explosion actually happened right at the same port city that we have had our first meeting with the Chairman when we discussed the recommended acquisition of ARM by SoftBank. So, if it's a little a bit earlier, it was dangerous. If it was a little bit later, it was dangerous too. And otherwise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and actually the Chairman of ARM was spending his days with family, and it was their vacation with his family, and I was able to stop by at the port of Turkey, and that's the occasion that we are able to have a meeting together. So, if I think about if it never stops and a little bit before then, there was Brexit that the EU withdraw from EU. If it was not Brexit, there may be not a right timing or there may be not a good timing. So, there are so many coincident happened one after another and changed history, at least for SoftBank, our company's corporate history has changed because of those many incidents happened one after another. So, this earnings announcement is right after this announcement of the recommended acquisition of ARM by SoftBank, so that I would like to touch on some updates regarding the financial actuals and also give you some another updates of our movements of SoftBank. So, today, this time, actually changed the schedules from the original schedules by a week or so is because the earnings result announcement by ARM was yesterday. If we were later than ARM's earnings results announcement, then that ARM needs to have to kept insider-information for the earnings announcement. And, also, that's another reason why that we have to change the date of the earnings results announcement of SoftBank Group Corp. as well. So, there are so many coincidence happening here and there and come to this conclusion. That's very interesting, that life is always interesting. Now that I would like to go into the details of the earnings result for three months period ended June 30, 2016. So, as you can see here, this is the overview for the highlights of the first quarter of 2016. Domestic Telecom, this is our cash flow or cash cow operation. It's making a very steady progress and also having a continued EBIT growth increased by 11%. And also this week, Sprint also made the earnings results announcement. Our adjusted EBITDA also made a significant increase by 18%, so they are also making a great progress, Yahoo! Japan as well, not only the traditional business model, but also e-commerce portion is mostly enhanced and putting efforts on. And that has increased by 38% in terms of transaction value. And last but not least, our investment assets that we have made a good progress on the monetization of our assets, such as Alibaba, Supercell, GungHo as we announced already. And here are the details of consolidate results. Net sales \\xe2\\x80\\x93 prior to that, net sales 3% increase; adjusted EBITDA 8% increase; EBIT 0.2% increase; net income 19% increase. So, I would like to go one by one. Net sales 3% increase. Sprint portion, actually looks a little \\xe2\\x80\\x93 decreased by \\xc2\\xa5100 billion or so, but this is due to the strong yen. And Sprint is a company in United States. So, when you see in dollar amount-wise, it is flat in dollar terms. So, from that sense, I believe Sprint is also making a smooth progress. And other than Sprint, it is also making quite a good progress as well. Adjusted EBITDA, record high over 13 consecutive periods. And the breakdown of it, Sprint in dollar terms, it has increased from \\xc2\\xa52.1 billion to \\xc2\\xa52.5 billion, so about 20% of increase here. So, in overall, in yen terms it's an 8% increase. But, in reality, it's making a double-digit increase here. And EBIT looks like a little bit of increase here. But this, again, we have a dollar-yen adjustment. And also Sprint is wholesaling the network in local market to local operator. And the contract of such wholesale has been terminated, replaced and re-contract to the future contract. And the new renewed one is actually making a better profitability. But because they need to terminate the contract once, so there are one-time loss recorded, but this is just a one-time effect. And also in substantially, actually it's making a better profitability in future, so we made a judgment that this is a good thing to do. So, considering all that, EBIT is actually also making quite a good progress as well. Financial status, after the ARM acquisition, the absolute number for debt has been considered by the market, because it could be very huge and I've been hearing such a feedback too. And I would like to express myself, how do I feel about it. But one thing I can say is that SoftBank, in the past, we've been actually catching the paradigm shift at the very beginning, and that happened about four times in the past. And actually, every time we made a loan, it's like all-or-nothing type of the bid that we have been making every time when we see the paradigm shift. For example, when we acquired Vodafone K.K., that was also the time where from the Internet to the mobile paradigm shift was happening, so that we loaned, we borrowed the money as much as we could, and we sold the assets that as much as we could. And before then, there was a broadband paradigm shift when we compete against NTT that was right after the burst of the Internet bubble, so that we sold everything we could sell. And also we borrowed everything we can borrow so that we made a huge bid there as well. But this time, right before the acquisition of ARM, it was 3.8 times. What is this number? The 3.8 times is the debt-EBITDA multiple. So EBITDA is not frequently used in Japan, but actually this is a very important indicator for financial KPI for European countries and U.S. And why EBITDA? It's because depreciation and amortization is only the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it does not come along with cash-out, so that when you see the revenues in cash only, then you will see the EBITDA. And how much times you will be able to raise debt? And how far can be healthy for the company? That is always a very basic KPI when the company makes a M&A. Up to about 4.5 times or so, such as cable companies that has a lot of M&A, but up to 4.5 times that is quite common sense. And when we acquired Vodafone K.K., it was 6.2 times. So, it was a little bit of a stretched multiple that we had experienced. And based on that, we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this time, it's going to be increased from 3.8 times to 4.4 times. It's a little bit of increase but still, it's within the range of healthy multiple. And in the mid-to-long-term period, we would like to reduce this down to 3.5 times level. That is going to be even better for company. That's how I think right now. But that's also \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we need some time and I believe that sometime in the future, we will be able to come to the 3.5 times in a few years. So, it's always our kind of indicator when we raise debt that we would like to make sure we will be able to bring the debt-EBITDA multiple down to 3.5 times in a few years or so. So, I think, that will be our most comfortable level of leverage rate. And compared to 3.5 times, it's a little bit higher but still, it's within okay range. So, that not the absolute numbers, but if you look at the multiple, that will be more important for you to valuate us. And another angle there is for you to look at our company, which is the net interest-bearing debt. So, those are the marketable securities, how much marketable securities do you have? That's another angle. So, if it's like a plant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for net \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how much debt can you raise against your net asset? But net asset is sometimes a little bit troublesome, because inside of your net asset, there are real estate, land or buildings for the plant, CapEx for the plant, those are also calculated in the net asset. But if you sell that, then you cannot really run your core business anymore. So, you cannot really sell those. But in our case, on our balance sheet, we don't raise any book value or anything, so it stays as a value when we invest it. But those are the marketable securities. And even we sell, but still that doesn't impact us to our core business and such marketable securities, we have about \\xc2\\xa59 trillion worthwhile. So, taking out the cash and how much asset do you have about debt and we have about \\xc2\\xa52 trillion surplus. So, actually, I could say there is no debt, because we have \\xc2\\xa52 trillion buffer there. And also, \\xc2\\xa5500 billion annual free cash flow is coming in every year basis. So, I see, for me personally, I have nothing to worry about. So, compared to those big bet that we've been making in the past four times of the paradigm shift, but this time I didn't really made a full swing, actually this is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 still we have a room there. So, that's a kind of a honest opinion of mine, at this moment. So, now, that I would like to go one-by-one in segments. Domestic Telecom, here, as I mentioned earlier, it's making very smooth progress, EBIT 11% increase. Accelerate growth via smartphones, FTTH. Churn rate actually has been lowered significantly, which I believe it means that customers are satisfied using our network. And our ARPU, the revenue per user has been stabilized as well. And these are the mobile sites. When it comes to the fixed-line, Yahoo! BB has been our business, and it's been about 15 years since then. And SoftBank, in the past 10 years or so that the SoftBank has been recognized as a mobile phone company and many people think that we are the mobile phone company only. But, actually, right before we acquired mobile operation that we've been investing in broadband and also we've been investing in Internet as well. And this broadband portion, broadband segment, in the gray portion here, this is Yahoo! BB. And also on your right, you can see optical fiber which is called as service name SoftBank Hikari is making a rapid growth. So, in sum of those two, as you can see, the blue line is making quite a growth. So, the fixed line cumulative subscribers number, so the PC-related Internet is increasing and the mobile Internet has been stabilized and CapEx has been peaked out. The reason why we have peaked out the CapEx is because, the connection ratio of network, just until recently there are so many complaints about SoftBank not being able to connected to the Internet. However, these past couple of years, SoftBank is making the best connections. Whenever you want to connect, you can get a connection. That has been achieved. As a result, we don't need to rush into CapEx anymore. The biggest portion for the CapEx is the tower buildings, construction of towers. And we have completed the construction of towers. As a result, free cash flow is making significantly. Up until recent quarter, it was negative because of CapEx and so on. We still need to cash out. But in this quarter we made a positive of \\xc2\\xa570 billion of free cash flow. So, this is after paying the tax, CapEx and everything. So, this is cash that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with you. And this \\xc2\\xa570 billion we disclosed this time, first time that how much this will be for the annual basis, that's going to be \\xc2\\xa5500 billion. So, this is the first time we announced the annual free cash flow guidelines from the Domestic Telecom business. After tax, after CapEx, how much money to be retained in the company, and we are expecting about \\xc2\\xa5500 billion free cash flow. So, that's a level that we are aiming or expecting right now for this year. So, that's why I said, we have enough room and we are comfortable to be able to repay those debt. And that's a kind of reason why that I am saying that. And next, big picture of the revenue opportunities, sales opportunities of SoftBank, why Domestic Telecom can be steadily increase the customers and also revenues. And that's because we have so many moves that have been made and also, that's making quite a good result as well. As a result, we are expecting a continued profit growth and also \\xc2\\xa5500 billion in free cash flow. That's why we have a base here. So, that is why that we'll be able to make a little bit about venture outside of the country. Next, Sprint, why we were able to make a decision to acquire ARM at \\xc2\\xa53 trillion, because domestically, we can expect \\xc2\\xa5500 billion of cash in Japan a year and Sprint overseas. The performance has been increasing dramatically. And Sprint is no longer the one that has liability to us, rather they can contribute to us. If you play Shogi, if you flip of chess to the other, immediately you can change the status from one to the other. My point is, adjusted EBITDA in Sprint \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sorry not Sprint, but adjusted EBITDA, I said, we were able to increase by 18% and free cash flow, even taking into account of CapEx in terms of free cash flow this year or early next year, Sprint is going to be positive free cash flow. In terms of quarterly basis, in fact Sprint is now cash positive. But annually, we expect Sprint to be cash positive either this year or next year. And OpEx savings, net adds improvement, revenue stabilization, diverse financing methods, network improvement, those four areas I have to work with Marcelo. We have seen a steady improvement in terms of net adds, postpaid phone. In terms of postpaid phone, the tablets don't make lot of money. They are just something to be added. And prepaid is also not making money either. So, in terms of contributor to income, postpaid phone or smartphone is the big driver of the income. So, in terms of postpaid phone, Sprint has 173,000 net adds, the first net add in five years. And when it comes to churn, which has been very high because of poor connectivity, but Sprint churn at the moment is lowest in Sprint history because of the improved network and improved service level. Before, the churn was over 2% but now, down to 1.39%, which is a significant improvement in terms of churn. And I touched upon net adds before, but per subscriber, average billing per user also is steadying well. As a result, again, Sprint was losing customer and losing income but now, it bottoms out. So, going forward, we should be able to see increased sales. In terms of yen, it looks like sales went down. But, again, Sprint is American business. You have to look in terms of dollar. So, again, Sprint performance has bottomed out. And in the past, Sprint spent a lot of money in terms of fixed cost. But now, Sprint has been trying hard to reduce fixed cost. SoftBank Mobile, for example, in terms of EBITDA, SoftBank Mobile is the best globally in terms of the EBITDA. And in terms of free cash flow, SoftBank Mobile is also the best, even better than Verizon, AT&T and China Mobile. So, when it comes to percentage of profit, SoftBank Mobile is best. And SoftBank Mobile has been making a lot of efforts. And Sprint has big number of users and a big number of sales than SoftBank Mobile. People are concerned about Sprint position, which is the fourth in the U.S., but SoftBank Mobile, which is the best in terms of profitability and EBITDA. So, Sprint is much bigger in terms of volume, of users and sales than SoftBank Mobile. So, so long as we are able to complete transferring expertise from SoftBank Mobile to Sprint, Sprint can be as good as AT&T and Verizon. So, Sprint should be able to make money in absolute term. There's a possibility, that's why I am glad that we bought Sprint. And even though we gave up merging Sprint with T-Mobile, but Sprint standalone can be great revenue contributor and profit contributor in SoftBank Group. So, that's why I'm glad that we acquired Sprint. In running marathon, if you are running far behind the top runners, you feel very tired and exhausted. And if score is bad in playing golf, it's really tiring to work from 1 to 18. But if you are running at the front of the group in marathon, you don't feel exhausted. In the past, Sprint saw revenue going down and user number going down. But since Sprint become a part of SoftBank, for four continuous years, Sprint has been improving adjusted EBITDA. So, again, Sprint is not a leg dragger, if you will, anymore. Sprint, rather, is beginning to see the top runners. That's why Sprint doesn't feel exhausted. In fact, I had a long detailed discussion with network engineers last night. I came back from London yesterday, and I had lot of meetings. And I had a call with Sprint teams up until 1:00 in the morning but it's not really tiring for me. In fact, it's exciting. It was completely different one year before and two years ago and it was like a hell. I wish I could've sold Sprint earlier fast. It was two years ago, one year ago. But now, I am so excited to have a call with network engineers. And I am excited to help building a Sprint network because we are beginning to see an improvement. And in terms of free cash flow, about $500 million positive in terms of quarterly basis. But on annual basis, usually, free cash flow goes negative. But, for the first time this year, we can expect positive free cash flow this year even though we may end up being a little bit negative free cash flow this year. But definitely, next year, we can expect positive free cash flow next year. So we can be positive free cash flow either this year or next year. That means we can repay debt. So, operating income goes up and debt goes down, that's great. And free cash flow positive does not necessarily mean no CapEx. On contrary, we are trying to build best, strongest network in the U.S., and I'm helping that. And download speed in terms of Nielsen test, Sprint is being number for some time. And a different third party RootMetrics compared to last half of last year, the first half of this year Sprint has been awarded more. So, network has been improving a lot, that's why Sprint churn level is the lowest in Sprint history. Why? Because network is better now. And Sprint financial may have concerned you before. But now, financing is doing pretty well in Sprint. So, I'm confident and you should feel confident with Sprint in terms of financing as well. So, Monday, this week on 25th, I believe, just a few days ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 three days ago, I think, Sprint had an earning call. And right after the earning result was announced, the stock price went up sharply. And as of today, 25% up since the earning result announcement. It happened just a few days ago and the stock price went up 25% in such a short term. It's really rare. That means U.S. investors finally feel confident and comfortable about Sprint performance improvement. So, before, there were a lot of negative media coverage and Sprint has always been negative part of SoftBank. But now, in terms of how much SoftBank spent to acquire Sprint, it was like \\xc2\\xa51.595 trillion. We spent \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion when we acquired Sprint. But Sprint market cap as of today is about \\xc2\\xa52 trillion. Up until recently, people thought that probably 50%, 80% SoftBank have to write down the acquisition cost. Even internally, we thought about that possibility. So, no wonder, people outside SoftBank were so concerned about Sprint. But now, even Sprint American investors feel comfortable after seeing Sprint earning results. So, again, I have to stress that in terms of yen, it's like this. But in terms of dollar, in fact, it went down. So, it's kind of tricky, but this is a fact. In terms of yen, Sprint market capital went up. When we acquired Sprint, Japanese yen was about \\xc2\\xa585 against the dollar. So, it was a good timing or maybe, we were smart enough or we were lucky to acquire Sprint that timing. But luck doesn't come with ability. So, we spent money. We borrowed Japanese yen and we spent Japanese yen to acquire Sprint. But as of now, Sprint is now positive to us rather than negative in terms of its market cap and in terms of acquisition cost. So, that's one of the reasons why I feel really confident with Sprint. So, that's why I was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we were able to decide to acquire ARM. People may ask why you made that decision? Is it because Nikesh left? Well, it's not the reason. Why did we decide to acquire ARM? Because we are confident finally to turn around the Sprint business. On top of \\xc2\\xa52.5 trillion of cash in hand, and now we have a line of sight to have \\xc2\\xa52 trillion or so of cash by monetizing Alibaba and exiting Supercell and GungHo and other businesses. That's why we were able to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we decided that we should be able to acquire ARM. So, \\xc2\\xa5500 billion of free cash flow and better Sprint performance and a good cash in hand, that's why we are ready to acquire ARM. On top of that, IoT, which is a paradigm shift to happen pretty soon. So, at this timing, we should aim to acquire someone like ARM. And then Brexit just happened. We didn't expect that, but Brexit just happened around that timing. So, I made a proposition in Turkey. And in two weeks, we were able to make an agreement with regards to acquisition of ARM. So, this M&A can be the biggest in terms of Japan history, in terms of the transaction, or the deal's amount. And making agreement in just two weeks, I think, is very rare because usually, it takes six months or so for negotiation and everything. But it took only two weeks to reach an agreement. And now, Yahoo!, we have seen continued growth and advertisement revenue \\xe2\\x80\\x93 while search-linked advertisement went down a little bit, but display ads went up. So, all-in-all, we have seen steady growth of advertising revenue. And shopping, which is the biggest focus and effort that Yahoo! is making, and it went up by 38%. I think that in terms of growth, Yahoo! is the best in e-commerce business, I believe. So, Yahoo! Japan is going well and our core businesses are, generally speaking, going well. Next is investment assets. The e-commerce Uber-type of ride-sharing service or FinTech. So, there are so many portfolio and that we're making an investment in such. By country basis, for the money-wise 60% for the U.S. and, actually, Asia, in 40%; and segment-wise, about 26% in ride-sharing, e-commerce 14%, so these are the kind of the maps for our capital deployment. And Didi, the ride-sharing service, Alibaba Group and Tencent Group was competing in the subsidiaries, and they merged together. They became the number one in Chinese markets. So, by the customer, riding customer number-wise, only one country in China actually exceed the number of riding customers in Uber of global market. So, Uber, the biggest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so, that the Didi became the biggest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 world's biggest ride-sharing company. And we are the shareholder of Didi, and we are increasing our ownership. Other than that, India, we also are making a investment in India one after another. And also, they are making a very good progress in their performance. And also, divesting is happening too. Supercell, for example, this is one of the largest gaming company in smartphone. And this has been sold to Tencent. So, about \\xc2\\xa51 trillion overall of the value, in that we had about 75% and investment return wise about 93% IRR. So, with this size, and achieving the 93% of IRR is very rare. And with this high return, we were able to divest this company. And also, Alibaba, we had a partial monetization of Alibaba share and those activities are happening. Therefore, we have reallocated our capital. And also, SoftBank, is it the operating company or is it the investment company? There are such questions, comes in and out. But, I say, we are both. And what are we doing in both operations? And we are doing the information revolution. So, to do the information revolution, not only our own operating asset but also, within the group companies, we like to generate the synergies so that we will be able to create information revolution. And for this investment operation, how much return are we gaining? And here, I said earlier, Supercell, GungHo, Alibaba, so including all that, we are achieving 44% of IRR. So, it's equivalent to about \\xc2\\xa510 trillion return. So, \\xc2\\xa5739 billion or close to \\xc2\\xa5740 billion investment amount, and now to \\xc2\\xa510 trillion. So, this is the result from our investment in Internet-related business. So, this return, if you look at any venture capital or any private equity in the world, I have never saw such achievements. The other day, Mr. Buffett, I had the opportunity to have a private meeting with Mr. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and he said, Masa, long time no see. And he said how am I doing. Mr. Bill Gates, myself and Mr. Buffett are close and sometimes play golf together and so on, so that I opted him. And I mentioned him that I made a 44% of our investment return and he said, that's great. So, even him \\xe2\\x80\\x93 make him surprised. So, I'm so happy to be able to make him surprised. With this size, with this level of return is not happening anywhere in the world except for us. That's how great the achievement is. And I am so happy to be able to be in such a position. So, what we've been doing as a core business, which is operating business and another vehicle, which is the investment operations as well as a group's strategy, both is doing very well so far. Under such a circumstance we made another next big bet. And to make a further growth since the foundation of the company, this was the biggest and also, core of the core business. That's how I have been thinking in myself. So, I mentioned about Domestic Telecom, Sprint, gathering those two can be coming close to AT&T and Verizon in terms of revenue and absolute figure. That's the kind of image. But still, this is going to be core of the core of SoftBank Group Corp., and this is going to be the core business five years later, 10 years later, 20 years later. When people ask, what is SoftBank Group does? Our core business is going to be ARM. That's how people would think in the future. And this is how big a position that ARM is taking amongst our group companies. \\xc2\\xa53.3 trillion, of which 70% is coming from cash on-hand. Loan was only about 30%. Those M&As that we've been doing in the past are compared to those cases. I believe this is the first time that we were able to use our cash on-hand for 70% of the acquisition amount. That's how we have room there to be able to exercise this project. And we didn't have to talk to and consult with many companies or firms, so that we were able to make this happen within a very limited timeframe, in short timeframe and also, without any leak of the information. And schedule-wise, announcement was made on July 18. And that we are expecting some time by the end of September, we will be able to close all the processes and procedures necessary. And we're working on that to be able to follow that timeline. And here \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so because we have already announced the 18th of July that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and also, they made an earnings announcement yesterday, so you already know about them and also, the situations. But as you can see from the earnings call yesterday, they are making good revenue and profitability, both in increasing trend. Net sales, operating profit, operating margin, they are exceeding 50% in operating margin. So, they are a high profit margin company. In absolute figure-wise, it is making even more linear growth. What I have talked to them after this announcement is making this growth anyway. So, in coming two years, three years or four years, five years, they shouldn't, they don't have to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even they may need to decrease the profitability, but why don't we increase sales, market share, engineers, R&D cost, to be prepared for the coming partnership, why don't we make a pre-investment, so that we can sacrifice the short-term period of the profitability. And they have sympathized with that idea, and they would like to do so. They would like to do that way, so that has been agreed between them and me. And they are the R&D company and those which design has been \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the design is sold to chip manufacturer. And what kind of companies are their clients? Renesas in Japan, for example or Apple, Samsung Qualcomm, well there are so many companies here are the clients of ARM. As a final product, smartphone, automobiles, consumer electric products, how much do they have in terms of market share? Smartphone, they have already close to 97% of market share in smartphone. It says 95% but, actually, substantially, it's 97% or close to the it's overwhelming market share leader and tablets, wearables, storage, automobile, infotainment, so it's a brain portion, not the windows or others but, actually, the brain of the automobiles portion that ARM is taking market share of 95%. So, they are enjoying the high market share in a variety of the segments. And also, the number of shipments, CPU gives you the image, kind of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 quickly that you may think of Intel when it comes to CPU. But Intel, the number of shipments annually and the number of shipments that ARM is making, and, actually, 40 times of number of shipment that ARM is making compared to the shipment of CPU by Intel over last year. So, microcontroller unit, and those are also included in the CPU numbers. And, actually, ARMs are shipping 40 times of the number of shipment that the CPU made by Intel. So processor portion, in total, 40 times of shipments. So, the CPU that's shipped to the global market and mainly are from ARM. ARM originally came from one kind, one type which is called Classic. And in the past \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in five years ago or so, the three other new models have been released, Cortex-A Cortex-R and Cortex-M. So, those three types has been released. Cortex-A is the application processor A; R indicates real time; M, indicates microcontroller. And each have different properties and depending on segment, depending on the purpose of use, designs for those specific segments and purpose of use and which is making a very high growth and accepted by many clients. Next year, what kind of new products are coming? The products coming next year actually gives you 30% better in performance, 30% better in power efficiency, and the footprint itself is going to be the smallest. In terms of performance, the one which is sold in smartphone is using the chipset shipped last year. So, year 2015 chip is now used in the current smartphone this year. For example, Galaxy's S6, Nexus 6P and so on, those are actually on the street. But the next year one, performance is going to be twice as much, so that the twice \\xe2\\x80\\x93 double the performance of today's smartphone is going to be realized next year. Size of the footprint is going to be smaller by 70%. So, 70% smaller chip is going to be available compared to those which is embedded in the smartphone this year. And the price of chip \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or the production cost of chip is relative to the size of the chip itself, meaning it's going to be cheaper in production. Every year, design is enhanced, so from 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer to 10-nanometers. In future, this ARM has already developing the technology which can bring this size down to 2.5-nanometers in the future. So, there are still lots of potentials, and this development goes on and on. Concerning all that, how important the design is and how high capability or the design capability has? And that is why more than 75% or 95% of companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of vendors of smartphone is adapting. So, smartphone, for example, GPU has been increased by 300 times compared to year 2009. So, ARM have the capability to develop one after another, applying for patent. And also, they are doing right to go for it trademarks will go for it. So, they have speed, reliability, scalability, real time. So, as I mentioned earlier, Cortex-A, Cortex-R and Cortex-M is already achieving number one architecture in modem and storage. For example, on automobile utilizing real time capability, when you hit the brake, brake has to be performed right away. And for such a real time capability wise, ARM is very good at it. It has a huge advantage on that. So, the quick speed, fast speed, it requires a fast process. So, it's not a computing power, but it's the speed more important. And when it comes to speed, ARM is the most advantageous. And M, Cortex-M, the microcontroller, it can be embedded to so many products of IoT one after another I believe. That is why ARM has created the world's number one computing ecosystem, Cortex-A, Cortex-R and Cortex-M. So, those are the primary designs and also developing environments and also using \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and companies that create application software using such developing the environments, so many in the world and it's also based on that that the vendor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 manufacturer of handset is creating these smartphones. So, that the ARM's chip is going to be used as a engine for those. And this is the market forecast or the shipments forecast towards 2020, and it is expecting quite a huge growth in every aspect. That is why SoftBank made the first action to come to the very core of the Internet. And, I believe, it can be translated into the compressive Internet companies. We've been changing our figures or the outlook, but it says, SoftBank. And why we put the name \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have this name SoftBank? It is a bank of software. From the first day of our company established, my image was the PC, it was just after the launch of PC, and PC was functioning individually. But I already thought that it's going to be connected to each other. And so, it's going to creating a internetwork. And once that they made internetworking and the hardware is going to be connected to each other and software \\xe2\\x80\\x93 those software with algorithm or the data, those I called it as a Soft, and that is going to be banked into one place. So, the Bank that we provide is going to be cumulated with the soft and hard and to be shared with the people around the world. So, it's like a cloud, I would say. We didn't have a world of cloud, at that moment, but I believe if we translate into the current world, I believe this is the image of cloud. And from the first day of establishing the company, I already imagined that. And right after I went to United States, when my age of 16, 17 that I start programming using computer, and that was my hobby, making up programs. And Berkeley of California has already connection between mainframe and PC, so that we were able to share e-mails and others, so that I have already experienced this Berkeley version of Unix. So, that the first experience of PC has been already making the interconnection, internetworking so that Soft and the data has already been shared and that's already been experienced by me so that when we start with PC, PC was individual timing, or it was not making an internetworking. However, I already knew it's going to be connected to each other. That's why it's not the application vendors for Soft, it's not the OS vendor, but we want to be the company which provide the cloud-type of environment. That's something that I thought from the very first day of the company foundation. And the chip is going to be the one to distribute to the world. Without chip, we cannot collect the data. So, those were the chip, yes. Then data is there, too. And those data will be connected to cloud through network. And that network in Japan and in United States, we already have in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now has as a group companies and ARM is going to be the chip to be provided to this network. And in coming 20 years or so, I think that there will be about 1 trillion units of chips to be distributed in 10 years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or 20 years. So, in 20 years, I believe there will be 1 trillion chip is going to be available on the globe. So, 1 trillion units of chip is going to be connected and also stored in the cloud in some kind of form. So, including all those, SoftBank is going to be operating as a comprehensive Internet company and also owns the comprehensive networking Internet. So, the name of the company, the SoftBank, now that we are close to the real meaning of the name of the company. And before we established the company, when I was year of 19, and I saw one picture with chipset. That already started my journey. That was the time when I started the journey of this business. And that's how I feel to announce this deal. And for the financing and the financial policy for this deal, we have no plans of the equity financing at all because we have already financed already. So, we have no need to issue a new share or anything like that. And also, we have no plan to change our dividend policy. And we will maintain flexibility with continued focus on the net debt reduction. So, down to about 3.5 times that we would like to aim for in terms of net debt to EBITDA ratio. So, that's how I focus on for our company. So, that is all for my presentation today. And after this, I would like to go into the Q&A session. But we keep growing, we never stop growing. And for that, I would spend my life and time and all passion to contribute to the humankind. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " '2016 Q2': \"My name is Son from Softbank. Thank you very much for joining today. Recently, there are a lot of thing that I regret or learned. What I'm regretting is that I was too conservative or I was too small \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think small, because there are things like paradigm shift going on, but too much focused on the daily routines, and just spent times on that. And for those days, I should have act more aggressively to address the evolution of technology in the paradigm shift of industry. However, in front of us, we need to turn around Sprint. That's the big challenge. And also we had in Japanese market, which is relatively small, we did have several challenges. And as entrepreneur and as a part of the information revolution, I was actually thought about myself in the regret, and learned from there that I have focused too much on the daily routines and didn't really thought big. SoftBank 2.0 was actually made to create SoftBank Group Corp. a more global and aggressive company to cope with any changes or dynamics of this industry, and we have to be the leading player of such a change. And the first change that we have made was the acquisition of ARM. By divesting something that [unwilling] asset, and made money to acquire ARM, and that is to be ready for the paradigm shift with ARM or in the industry, and I've been thinking about this company for the past 10 years, and I made a decision, but that was not enough. That was just the beginning of SoftBank 2.0. That was my thought, and pursue the big changes or big growth of the company, we also had to focus on the debt level. Of course, easy to say that we reduce our debt by half, by selling half of our position of Alibaba, that can be easily reduce our net interest bearing debt. But I still believe in Alibaba's future. It is still in the process of growth, and it has a big future. Last week, there was earnings result announcement by Alibaba, and as you can see from there, they are still making a big growth and in the middle of the growth. From that sense, not divesting our asset, but those because are still very much promising in making a growth, so not selling those, but still at the same time be ready for the change, what kind of things needs to be prepared, and the answer was SoftBank Vision Fund that I came up with. And when we create such a base, then it shouldn't be small. We should think big. So that is why that we announced the creation of SoftBank Vision Fund with \\xc2\\xa510 trillion. That's also in my presentation. Now, that I would like to go to the presentation material. Consolidated results; this content is rather boring, but the numbers are growing. And I think we have to go at least this much. Net sales, adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and net income, they're all growing. And if I could explain this a little in yen basis, it is down by 0.2%, but the domestic business is growing in sales and profit. Now, overseas business, Sprint. On dollar terms, sales is growing, but on yen basis because of the strong yen, the sales is declining slightly, and that is just an excuse. But adjusted EBITDA is growing both on yen basis and dollar basis, 7% growth. Yellow part is Sprint. As I said at the outset, until now, it was a drag on SoftBank's consolidated profit. It was a drag. However, going forward, Sprint will at least be profit growth engine of SoftBank Group, Sprint will be a growth engine. And I have been confident recently that, that will be the case, and I will elaborate on this later. EBIT is also growing and the breakdown is as follows; Yahoo Japan, last year consolidated ASKUL, so there is a one-off profit. But excluding this event, the Domestic Telco, Yahoo Japan, Sprint are all growing steadily. The growth, in terms of growth rate, in terms of profit contribution, Sprint will be the largest factor. With the acquisition of ARM, SoftBank's consolidated net debt-EBITDA multiple has once exceeded 4 times, but in the near future, within a few years, this will be below 3.5 times, and once we fall below 3.5 times, this will be a healthy level. And we think this below 3.5 times multiple will be possible. Now, let me talk about the major segments, starting with Domestic business. Domestic Telco EBIT plus 9% growth. It is boring but steady growth. And the cumulative number of subscribers is growing. And since the start of SoftBank Mobile, churn rate has been at the lowest level. And we are making various efforts to acquire customers, subscribers. SoftBank Hikari, this is the driver of customer acquisition and is now functioning fully and steadily. And as a result, the churn rate is improving significantly, and free cash flow is also growing dramatically. The free cash flow on accounting basis can be expressed in various ways, but what is important is free cash flow as a result of business, CapEx or tax including those factors, free cash flow is a money that we have in the end, and free cash flow is now finally at the harvest phase, \\xc2\\xa5600 billion level of free cash flow. So we think we are in a steady harvesting phase. Going forward, we will be able to generate cash in a stable fashion going forward. So the Domestic Telco is trending very stably. Next is Sprint. For the past three years, Sprint has been a drag on our consolidated basis and was the biggest reason our debt increased. Originally, Sprint and T-Mobile, we were going to acquire both, merge them and have a company that is equal to AT&T and Verizon to have a head-on competition. That was our basic strategy, but because of the rejection by the U.S. government, our basic strategy did not work out. But as a result, we've had difficulty, but we made steady effort. And as a result, the net loss stopped, and net addition, we were able to make a turnaround for net addition. So now we are seeing a steady increase in the number of subscribers. The churn rate is now at the best level in Sprint history. And as a result, churn rate is down, and subscribers is now net addition. So the sales decline did not stop, and the sales was declining in accelerated pace, but now, we are finally hitting the bottom and making a turnaround. It is easy to increase cost to increase sales. Increasing sales to increase the number of subscribers is easy. But what we're doing is decreasing, reducing the cost and increase sales. This is not easy. It's not easy to reduce cost and increase the number of users. But we're doing this at the same time. And as a result, Sprint's EBITDA, the profit before depreciation has now doubled since we acquired Sprint. In a few more years, Sprint will be the most dramatic large-scale turnaround in the U.S. history. They will be marked in the U.S. economic history, that this will be a big, most dramatic turnaround in a few years. As a result, Sprint's free cash flow has made a turnaround. Until now, it was hundreds of billions of yen of loss every year. This is only first half, but on annual basis it was hundreds of billions of yen loss deficit. But now, it is turning around to enter the positive territory. So cost is reduced, fixed cost is reduced, CapEx is reduced significantly. CapEx is now reduced by hundreds of billions of yen. But even then, the network improvement among the U.S. companies is showing the biggest improvement. This is because we are utilizing the network-designing technology that SoftBank has cultivated over the years, and this is functioning well. So Sprint's network is now steadily improving and showing the highest improvement rate. Free cash flow is improving, and network is improving, and that is why Sprint's churn rate is showing the biggest improvement at the highest level ever, best level ever. So, Sprint had been a drag until now, but finally, we are seeing a good prospect of a turnaround. So now, we can turn again to offense. So we are finally at that stage. Another domestic business, Yahoo Japan. Yahoo Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the U.S. Yahoo posted big loss and had to do a restructuring and at the point of selling, but Yahoo Japan is growing steadily. Ads is now shifting from PC to smartphones, and in the small screen, the search ad and display ad value was seen to be declining. But Yahoo Japan is overcoming this crisis, and in e-commerce, it is showing the biggest growth in Japan. Yahoo is growing the most in e-commerce in Japan. And the SoftBank 2.0, as a first step of the aggressive move, ARM acquisition has been announced, and after we actually complete the transaction and see the management, meet with management, and also made a visit to the major clients together with CEO Simon here. There are major seven or eight clients that we have made a visit, and we had a management-to-management discussion. And they are telling me that the ARM is essential company, and that they would like to make a contract for about 10 years, coming 10 years or so. And actually, I have already made development road map for coming 10 years or so. There are so many companies around there in the world, but actually, there are no such company who can foresee 10 years ahead, and create a clear vision of the 10-year ahead of development road map. With such a fast evolving industry, and actually, they are creating engine equivalence of the part of the industry in designing, building 10-year ahead of the road map for the designs, and each client showed us a strong interest on joint development, joint project and so on. So we are happy to hear those. So I am so happy and even more confident in ARM acquisition. And also, latest technologies create new revenue streams and making a rapid growth there. So in the various types of products, ARM is in it. IoT, about 1 trillion products will be with an ARM product going forward. Not only those small devices, but also in those network and servers like big equipments, such as base stations of telecommunication service and so on also mounted with intelligent antenna also are using ARM antennas and so on. For server side of the infrastructure and also cloud side, the ARM core is going to be providing more and more services and also supercomputer, Post-K supercomputer. This is also the national project of Japan. And the Post-K has already adopted and also decide to redesign with ARM architecture. So not the original made, but actually going to use so much ARM products so that they will be able to come up with more reasonable. And also, a power-efficient, energy-efficient structure is going to be made. So not only for the small devices such as smartphone or IoT devices, but ARM is also being used and going to be used with such huge projects or the products. And also, security is going to be even more important going forward. And recently, in IoT area, virus is becoming more issue in hacking incidents happening here and there, that has been also covered in media and newspapers. Going forward, security is going to be even more important, and that has been reconfirmed. So even if you buy new car, do you know, those cars sold as of today per car. Did you know that there are hundreds of ARM products in one car, did you know that there are hundreds of ARM products in one car, did you know that, several hundreds of ARM products in one car. And not only ARM but also various microcomputer chipsets are there in the car, did you know that? So those cars that you're driving as of today, right now, while you're buying, so actually, those chipsets are all dead in a sense that those are not encrypted. There are no such security in those chips' areas at all. So far, car was only operated inside of the car and making a communication between chipset and chipset inside of one car. So the communication was completed inside of one car. Therefore, there was no such need for encryption. Car or automobile producers are not the experts of microcomputer. They are just buying microchip outside of the company, and just put it into the car. So they are not the expert of semiconductor. So purely or innocently, they are buying those chips and building, mounting on their cars. There is no such encryption in the car production, but we didn't have to worry about that too much. But you know now, there are connected car available around and it's already being covered by many medias. What is connected car? What car is connected to the Internet? So, the communication inside of the car is not completed inside of the car, but actually it goes out of the car. So, not the internal communication anymore, but the car is making external communication, so that the they're communicating with Internet, connecting with Internet, such era already has come. So, once you're connected to the Internet, not only the beneficial information is connected, but at the same time, you may be connected to the viruses. So, you have a possibility of being hacked. But although there are no such encryption made in the chipset, and once the virus comes in, what happen? All of the funds, the car around the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all the cars around the world could kick off the virus inside of the car and it could stop all the car, all the brakes are going to be out of service all of the sudden on the highway or sometime \\xe2\\x80\\x93 somewhere. Then, highway system could be damaged for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or 30 years equivalent. Maybe also a big huge risk of losing a lot of lives also. So, that kind of things are coming very near. So, we cannot already innocently just putting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 buying those chipset and then putting into the car anymore, it is going to be the matter of national security, it's going to be the matter of human beings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 lives. So, car which was not encrypted should not be connected and that kind of law needs to be regulated. And also, automobile producers should recall those cars which has not been encrypted. So, once that information totality comes in, meaning that you have more convenience, but at the same time, you need to pay for the risk so that security is going to be the most important tool. At the same time, more reasonable, energy efficient, but also safety and security encrypted chipset is going to be most needed and that is going to be very important. And for that, ARM, this time, new product Cortex-M33, Cortex-M23 has enhanced their security level, and at the same time, very small size. So, 80% reduction of the size or the 95% smaller. So, you can see that this is the head of the pencil that it is going to be about the same size. So, this is even smaller in M23. So, smaller and more efficient in energy and high capability, but at the same time, highly secured. Usually, if you enhance the security, meaning you need to encrypt it, the encryption, meaning you need to encrypt it too, therefore, the performance is going to be, go down. There are lots of burden on that, but still at the same time, we have improved the capabilities of performance, but at the same time, enhance the encryptions securities. For ARM, equals to safety and secured. ARM inside is better actually. If you are not using ARM, meaning that you're going to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you have to worry about the security, so that I believe that is going to be the kind of keyword. So, from that sense, that I am so happy to be able to have this company with our group and number of shipments is increasing even more dramatically and exclusively, so that the SoftBank 2.0 and this is the first step of SoftBank 2.0, why SoftBank Group have sold Supercell shares, GungHo shares and also even the Alibaba shares, partly sold unwillingly, and went to the investment in the ARM. It's because we want it to be very much prepared for the time of the paradigm shift and that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that I will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 touch on later. But before I go into that, why I didn't wanted to sell \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was unwilling sale of share of Alibaba. That's something that, for your confirmation, that I would like to pick up some pages. Last week announcement, Alibaba earnings results was made. Market cap actually exceeded Toyota, which is the biggest in Japan in terms of market cap. So, the market cap level is already bigger than that Toyota, \\xc2\\xa520-some trillion, and in the past one year total revenue have increased by 55%. Net income in the latest three months, \\xc2\\xa5200 billion. Only for three months, a \\xc2\\xa5200 billion net income. And the size has increased by 41%, and Alibaba has not been in a matured stage yet. Actually, it's making a lot of investment such as the Ali Cloud and finance, Alipay and so on. So, there are lots of investments are also happening in Alibaba and not yet been matured but already making \\xc2\\xa5200 billion per 3 months and also making the increase of 41% in net income. So actually, I didn't want to sell up share of Alibaba, but even I needed to sell a part of it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually, we still have about \\xc2\\xa57 trillion to \\xc2\\xa58 trillion equivalent of the Alibaba share with us, but actually this time, they will have sold for \\xc2\\xa51 trillion equivalent and still I wanted to do this first step of SoftBank 2.0. And that is because I wanted to accelerate the growth strategy of SoftBank Group to entering into SoftBank 2.0. Why are we heading there? It's because there are visions that I'm so sure about and I am so confident. You may not agree with me, but for me, this is something that I am so confident that we need to be serious about as a group, which is singularity. I've been picking this word so many times in a public occasion, and speaking of singularity but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 intelligent capability of computer is possibly exceeding the intelligence of human being and we are almost there. Actually, in some segments, that has already been happening such as chess or go or \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so, those kind of things has already shown and proved that intelligence of computer exceeded the human being's intelligence. So, game of Go or chess is the limited area for now, but actually that will be happening in a variety of areas. So, as the singularity time that the computer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it will exceed, which means that all the industry needs to be redefined. So, as like industrial revolution, like agricultural or those manual productions, those kind of industry has completely changed by having the energies, and that has been defined after the industrial revolution. So, in the past, that those locomotive things have entered after having energy and actually exceed the manpower and you can bring \\xe2\\x80\\x93 transport the things much faster and much longer. That's the industrial revolution. But in information revolution, not the manpower, actually you have energy, so the human thinking is not anymore \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually, microcomputer will give you even faster and deeper and precise answers than human thinks and also can improve the productivity. So that kind of era is already coming so close, which means once again that all industry will be redefined like robot type of service is one example, good example, I believe. Airbnb is another the example. Fintech, also already been redefining the financial businesses. Telephone, actually, was mainly used for the voice call, but thanks for Steve Jobs, that has been changed to smartphone, so redefined as a smartphone using the data or Internet. And Steve Jobs actually said that he re-innovate the phone and that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we start at Apple, reborn as the biggest market cap company, it was almost bankrupting before but actually that kind of change made a huge big change for the company. And this kind of change will be happening here and there, one after another. And this is not only for the one team, one industry or one business model. Actually, it's the very much basic change and actually the surge is going to be bigger than what has happened in industrial revolution. And this can be regarded as the biggest project of human being. And SoftBank alone cannot be in time to hold those changes. Such a huge change is happening here and we alone cannot do that or cannot lead that. That's why, I actually regret those past days and decide to go into the new case, which is SoftBank 2.0. And as a part of 2.0 that we made the acquisition of ARM. But still there was a challenge. And you may heard so many times and we actually scared so many times that SoftBank has huge debt. That was a big challenge. So, you have a good motivation, but you have too many debt as well. That's the kind of concern that the market told us. So, not increasing any debt, but at the same time we need to adjust this revolution. That's how I think about. And I was thinking about so hard, and came to this conclusion, which is SoftBank Vision Fund. So, the first step of ARM acquisition of SoftBank 2.0, our debt leverage ratio actually exceeded 4.0 times. At the time of acquisition of Vodafone K.K., we went to about 6.5 times or so. And we reduced our leverage ratio and with Sprint acquisition and ARM acquisition, we have increased to 4.0 times. So, leverage ratio-wise, it became 4.0 or above. If you add more debt, then we cannot really adjust to SoftBank 2.0. So, what we should do? Of course, like I said earlier that we can \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are earning about \\xc2\\xa5600 billion level of the free cash flow from the telecom, as a telecom operator that but that will not be enough. That level of the money will not be enough for the time of SoftBank 2.0. And here that we are trying to improve that balance sheet by reducing the leverage ratio from 4.4 times to 3.5 times and, at the same time, being aggressive mode, which is the reason why that we came to this conclusion of SoftBank Vision Fund, and size is about \\xc2\\xa510 trillion. AIIB, that's mainly debt by China, was about \\xc2\\xa510 trillion is the aggregated amount of the venture capital in United States for the past two years or the equivalent to 2.5 years equivalent of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all the total aggregated amount financed by joint venture capital in the United States. Investment fund of private equity, the biggest one financing amount, actually, we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ours is 4.5 times of those or the size is like that but, at the same time, I believe \\xc2\\xa510 trillion is something. And, to me, this is the first step. So, I actually wanted to kind of mind you that this is the entrance of SoftBank 2.0. And with this \\xc2\\xa510 trillion, we would like to make it successful, and then we can think about the next step. But out of \\xc2\\xa510 trillion, \\xc2\\xa52.5 trillion is going to be coming from us. And, as a partner, for the first partner who agreed with this idea was Saudi Arabia PIF, Public Investment Fund, money, that agreed the idea and putting the money of \\xc2\\xa54.5 trillion. And other investors, we are contacting to several potential investors. And we have received a strong interest. So, that we are quite sure that we'll be able to raise about \\xc2\\xa510 trillion and our investment track record, so we were cultivating our market one by one. And that is giving us a \\xc2\\xa5600 billion lever of the free cash flow after tax only from Japan. But at the other hand, for the return of investment business, we have about 44%. So, this 44% is the track record from the past 18 years. In the past 18 years, we have made the investment into the Internet companies and made a return which is 44%. So, we are actually doubling the return in every two years. And here, because we made a big success in Alibaba, so that's why we made a big achievement, that's not true. Actually, it's not really coming only from Alibaba. Of course, the size-wise Alibaba is huge, but if we exclude Alibaba, what happen to our IRR? That kind of question is frequently asked, and we actually worked on that. And if we exclude Alibaba, our IRR was 43%. So, even without the big success of Alibaba, IRR already been achieving 43%, not 44%. And this is because that we made a small company, so that we have a huge return. So, what happen if we also include the telecom operators? What I said that there was heavy burden, which is Sprint and also Vodafone K.K. If we add all those two and recalculate, then the investment amount is about \\xc2\\xa530 billion and the return was \\xc2\\xa5190 billion. So, we invest \\xc2\\xa53 trillion and we received as a return of \\xc2\\xa520 trillion. So, this return \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we have searched for over 18 years, not like 3 years or 2 years something like that. But we have searched and study once again and we have made this much of the return so far during the past 18 years. We have also compared with major funds in the company. So, we don't specify the name here. But they are actually making about 15% to 10% level, and that's the IRR that they are making. So, there are no such company that are achieving 44% IRR. So this was the result, so we were, once again had the confidence in ourselves regarding investment activities as well. So, in the SoftBank 2.0, we want to be so ready for the biggest opportunity in humankind, which is singularity. And this is a partner that will actually respond to me first, young leader in Saudi and he said, yes, we will do it together. So, we made a very good discussion and he agreed with my idea. This happened about last month and we signed the memorandum, and he himself also had a strong interest to have SoftBank as his partner. So, here, the financial strategy, SoftBank is going to be improving our leverage, from 4.0 times down to 3.5 times within a couple of years, and further down going forward. So, that any investments above \\xc2\\xa510 billion, will be, in principle, made through this fund. So, it's going to be non-recourse to SoftBank Group so that this could not be influencing to SoftBank Group for the major investment. It will not be made adding more debt in SoftBank Group but actually inviting partners and raise money and also receiving some fees from partners and making a successful investments so that we will show to improve our balance sheet because we are generating \\xc2\\xa5600 billion of free cash flow and also new investments with certain sites is going to be made through this fund. So that, naturally speaking, that our leverage is going to be improved. So, structurally our balance sheet is going to be improved from that sense. So, the biggest opportunity in humankind which is singularity, and we want to be ready for that and we will or become the leading players in the singularity with more security. So, we would like to head towards the SoftBank 2.0 Thank you very much for your attention, that is all for me.\",\n",
       " '2016 Q3': \"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Son. Thank you very much for joining today. So, recently, I'm thinking, right after the foundation of the company, we are always wondering about the cash management by the end of the month. So, that every month cash management and the achievement of the budget was the kind of big part of my brains or a big part of my heart. Ten years later, since then, we have listed our company, and not one month by one month, but the way we came to see three months or one year, so that we are able to see a little bit longer term of the period. Recently what happened to this year, what happened to this quarter is not really the focus but rather we are focusing on the 10 years later, how we're going to form our company 10 years later, 30 years later. So, I am seriously thinking to sustain the company or the group towards 300 years, so that we would like to set such the foundations to sustain 300 years while I am still young, and that we would like to also consider and pass the torch to the successor. For that, what kind of foundation is necessary? What kind of format do we need to set? That's something that I am spending my times these days. So, from that sense, SoftBank 2.0 is something that are in our mind and the acquisition of ARM was the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the biggest step for the SoftBank Group towards SoftBank 2.0. And starting from there, we are trying to be ready to be more aggressive, and that is why that we studied for the SoftBank Vision Fund and we are We are making quite a good progress. And now, we are in a very much last phase of the SoftBank Vision Fund closure. And because of the regulatory point of view, we are in the quiet period, so that I cannot discuss any of the details on SoftBank Vision Fund at this moment from the regulatory's point of view. Meaning that we are very much ready and now that we are quite sure to be able to launch this fund. So, it's becoming more and more realistic. And this is something \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it is very important, playing an important role for SoftBank to grow 10 years, 30 years and 300 years. So, today, during this announcement that we will discuss and present the progress in the last three months of period. And as I mentioned earlier, I cannot discuss the details of the Vision Fund, but I think we can touch on a little bit of the concept of the fund. So, this is a SoftBank, which is entering into the new phase, and I hope you can feel some of those. And also, we will welcome your questions afterwards. So, just to let you know in advance, no politics questions, please. No U.S. politics, please. That's something that I don't want you to ask me about. Even you ask me anything related to politics, I'm not in the position that I can make any comments, so please note that in advance. This is to present you the business overview of the SoftBank, just to remind you. Thank you very much. SoftBank. As I mentioned a little bit here, what is SoftBank, you may wonder. What SoftBank does? What is the business domain of SoftBank? Recently, this company acquired ARM. Is this a chipset company? Isn't it away from the core business of SoftBank? That maybe some \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many people may surprised at then they ask question about. But since its foundation, SoftBank never changed in terms of Information Revolution. We've been pursuing the Information Revolution all the time since its foundation. A great person, Mr. Ryoma Sakamoto, who I respect most, but he devoted himself to was for the Meiji Restoration. At the time, he was also a good at the kendo swords and also sometimes they change to the gun, sometimes they change through the chips. And also, he made a lot of savings and also touched on some frameworks for the law and regulations. And afterwards, he became the person to set directions and the framework for the Meiji Restorations. That became later on new constitutions for the new government of Japan. So, even that the form or the posture may change, but he was always devoting himself to the change of the period, change of the country. So, SoftBank, we have started with the distribution of PC software in the beginning. And after then, we have also started some publications, and then started the Internet business, and that Internet company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Internet business now entering into the mobile Internet. At the time we acquired Vodafone K.K., some people said why SoftBank acquiring the mobile telecommunication, which is totally away from the core business. But actually, in my mind, in my big picture, actually I never changed my policy. Actually, I was always consistent towards the Information Revolution, and the mainstream for that revolution is always one thing, which is the chipset with the microcomputer. At the year of 19 or maybe I was 17 or 18, sometime later teens, I first saw the photo of micro computer chipset, and that time there was no such word of singularity, but this chipset actually will exceed the human brains and human intelligence. That's something that I imagined of. And also, I was so impressed, and actually my tears came out from my eyes and I never changed my desires. I've been devoted myself into the Information Revolution all my life. So, that has changed from PC to mobile, and now mobile to Internet of Things. So, every things, glasses, pair of glasses, pair of shoes, washing machines, automobiles, everything is going to be built with the Internet. So, the core or the center is going to be changed to the IoT. And I always try to be in the center of those trend and try to kind of aim in such business every time. So, always trying to be the latest edge of the technology, and we are challenging towards that. That's the kind of a company that SoftBank is. And we need to accelerate this Information Revolution. To accelerate, we have set the foundations for the SoftBank 2.0. So, that's kind of main policies of our company. And now, that I would like to share with you our consolidated results of the latest three months period. As we can see, our business performance is doing very good. In one word, it's very good, making a good progress. And our net sales are down 0.3%, but as you can see, domestic Yahoo! distributions, everything doing great. Sprint, this is a company in the United States, and their net sales, in dollar base, it's increasing, but because of the impact of strong yen, it has some decrease there. So, maybe we should consider in dollar base or should be considering in Japanese yen base because we are Japanese company. I think that's depending on how you see, but just that's the kind of reason why. And EBITDA increased by 9% and breakdown. Domestic Telecom, Yahoo!, everything's in good progress. Sprint, regardless of the currency, Sprint EBITDA is increasing, everything doing great. EBIT up by 18% and breakdown here. And earnings results 2, 3 times ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 periods ago, Sprint, probably you was expecting that the U.S. almost bankrupt and you'll never be able to see any solutions for that. But in my mind, in my head, as a matter of fact, I was already so sure that Sprint is going to become the driving force for the group's growth, and I'm becoming more and more confident. And now, you can see the result. You can see in numbers. Sprint operating income, EBIT is now almost 3 times. So, it says up 18%, of which the biggest portion of the incrementals are coming from the Sprint. And I believe this status or this situation is going to grow even further. And after the ARM acquisition or the Sprint acquisition, we have seen the net debt increased. However, EBITDA is also increasing at the same time, and also the large investment going forward is going to be going through the fund, so that borrowings or the net interest bearing debt to EBITDA is going to decrease going forward. If it's too low, it may be too good from my understanding because that means that we need to pass on the growth opportunity. So, we would like to kind of keep the healthy level of leverage. It's better for the business. So, within the healthy range, which is between 3 to 3.5 times is something ideal, also that we can put some guess, but at the same time that we can grow at the same time. So, that's kind of a level that I am thinking as kind of a comfortable level. And we would like to coming down to 3 point times level sometime in the future. 3.5 times I said, but in my mind, in my calculation, this is zero times because we have marketable securities with us which are already listed. And with that amount, actually, we have more than what we have borrowed, so we can make it zero if we wish to. So, that's why that I am so comfortable with this number. And next slide I would like to go into the status of major segments. First, Domestic Telecommunications. Domestic Telecommunications' EBIT went up 9%, so it is growing smoothly, and the number of subscribers is also growing smoothly, 540,000 increase year-on-year. In addition to that, SoftBank Mobile, Yahoo Japan business are deepening their collaboration, so Yahoo! Shopping is now growing greatly. And users of SoftBank Mobile and Yahoo! Shopping business cooperation is being enhanced. So, we have a campaign of giving 10 times points, which started this month. And as a result, this has just started, but according to our latest information, we are seeing very good results. So, three months later, I believe I will be able to tell you the content of what is good about it. And before mobile, fixed broadband ADSL was started. Fixed broadband, to make Internet faster, ADSL was started. At ADSL at the start, that was one of the early technologies to start, but now this is being replaced with optical fiber, FTTH, and to link to the home. This business is growing greatly and I believe that this will continue to grow 2.6 times year-on-year is the current level. So, I believe this will further grow and this is something that we can grow by generating profit at the same time. As a result, free cash flow also is growing. After tax, after CapEx, this is the cash income that remains. From an accounting perspective, there are many ways of expressing revenue like EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA, operating income, ordinary income, net income. There are many ways of expressing in accounting terms or whether that is based on U.S. GAAP or IFRS or the Japanese Accounting Standards. Depending on accounting standard, the way you measure is different. But the final fact that remains ultimately is cash. Cash, regardless of what happens, that is the fact. And the cash, in the last three years, free cash flow is growing dramatically. That is the income made in one year. In nine months, \\xc2\\xa5434.9 billion cash income is generated. For the full year, for Domestic Telecom, only \\xc2\\xa5500 billion free cash flow was our projection. But now, as of today, I am making upward revision. So, the free cash flow, 20% compared to net sales, is the largest ratio in the world. Our Domestic Telecom business is one of the major businesses with one of the best business efficiencies in the world. Many people said that SoftBank may go bankrupt. SoftBank's telecommunications is facing crisis. But in terms of free cash flow, the ultimate profit, we are able to generate profit. So, Domestic Telecom business is growing and will continue to grow steadily as Mr. Miyauchi is doing a good job as a President. He will continue to do so going forward, and I'm quite confident about it. And also important domestic business is Yahoo Japan. Yahoo! in the U.S. face a variety of difficulties, but Yahoo Japan, we see by Yahoo! Group is the only entity increasing profit and growing every year. Yahoo Japan have several profit models, but one important pillar is advertising revenue. Advertising revenue, which is a Search ads and Display ads, both are growing or 10% growth year-on-year. So, this is how this has improved. And another important pillar is e-commerce. E-commerce revolution was something that I announced three years ago. As a chairman of Yahoo Japan, I myself, I took the leadership to make a transformational business model of Yahoo! Shopping. And in three years, the number of merchants increased by 16 times. I'm not going to mention the names of competitors, but that is 10 times compared to the number of merchants of competitors, 10 times more than that of our competitors. E-commerce revolution, with that we changed the business model. And then, as a result, in three years, there was increase of 16 times, 10 times compared to our competitors. Before that, for 10 years, there was no growth at all. But all of a sudden, there was increase of 10 times compared to competitors. As a result, net sales also doubled. So, we could establish our model for the next 5 or 10 years. E-commerce, Yahoo Japan and Shopping growth model is made. So, we have to further increase execution and realize this. And I'm quite confident that we are able to do that. The most challenging business was Sprint. Now, SoftBank was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 often hear that we will be making a big loss because of Sprint. And also, it was said that SoftBank is going to acquire Sprint and also T-Mobile to be against the two big player, Verizon and AT&T, and try to make a three competitors world, and that was the original thought at that moment. But unfortunately, that moment the regulatory in United States was not accepting that idea, so that the first strategy was not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 did not happen, so that the Sprint had to go by itself. So, maybe we shouldn't have bought that. I made a regret \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I regretted my decisions back then because my assumption was that the merger in between those two is going to be accepted but I was wrong. So, I lost my confident that moment and I really didn't like the world anymore. And I made a lot of thinking and my hair gone, too, and I would like to sell the company. That was the kind of feeling I had at that moment. Even in the earnings results announcement I said that it's a long, long journey to go. The situation was so bad. It was a kind of a terrible track record back then. Network quality was the worst; net additions, the worst; acquisition was the worst; margin was worst; free cash flow was all red; and actually, money is flowing out, more and more debt. So, that was the situation the Sprint was, so that we made so much effort and we suffered a lot. And with that decisions of acquiring the company, many people said that we're going to suffer even more longer and that nobody is going to buy it. So, we had no choice but we had to turn it around by itself with the four strategies, four turnaround strategy. First of all is network improvement, the net adds improvement, cost reduction and diversify financing methods. So, those four strategies, it was actually led. I, myself, also involved as a Chief Network Officer. Marcelo was leading sales and the cost reduction. But when it comes to network, he was not the expert, so he asked me and because I have been saying that I am taking the responsibility for that. So, that's why I said that I can lead that. And even today, I, myself is having a call every week to discuss the details of the network design with Sprint members and also checking the progress of the status. Starting from 10:00 till 12:00 at night every week, I, myself, as a Chief Network Officer, that I'm involved in the conference call. Normally, the Chief Network Officer is engineer and no management responsibility. So, what they do is they're trying to get the budget for CapEx, trying to get the money, first of all, and need to get the budget first, secure the budget. So, that's the first thing that Chief Network Officer has to do and ask CEO for the budget. But me, I, myself is owner and at the same time Chief Network Officer, so I always ask, team, why you're going to need such money, what are you going to use it for. So, that's the kind of question we all need to ask so that amongst the four competitors, we made the least CapEx. But actually, we made the fastest improvements in network quality amongst the four. It's easy to say, as a Chief Network Officer, if you can spit so much money and improve the network. That is easy because there are a lot of vendors to provide you the equipments, and the vendors, they will be cooperative to improve the network, to structure and build the next-generation network. So, they asked us to buy that, but I just said no. We all rejected the budget request. And I, myself, involved in design from the scratch, so that we could spend only least amount of CapEx. But as a matter of fact, that we were able to improve the network. And we are becoming number one sometime soon. SoftBank network is the best connectivity amongst the world. Here, in Japan, you see SoftBank, DOCOMO, KDDI, three competitors are competing so fiercely to improve the net profit improvements. So, you take it very common, but if you go outside the country, if you go to the overseas, you're surprised to learn how good the Japanese network is and how good the LTE network is in Japan. And you're so amazed how lucky you are to be able to have such a great connectivity in Japan. That's something that I first learned when I involved in the Sprint management. I understand that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how our network is not good in terms of quality. But without spending much money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually, we just had the earnings results announcement in Sprint recently and many people misunderstood because we're not spending enough money, so that we cannot improve the network. And I understand that, but that's totally wrong and a big misunderstanding. If you spent enough money, that doesn't necessarily mean that you can make a big improvement. Of course, that will make a good improvement, but what makes SoftBank Mobile, the company with best free cash flow, is that because we minimize the spending on CapEx and creating a great network, that's why that we became the best free cash flow operator amongst the world, so the least spending and the best improvements in network. Not only the improvement, but also absolute number-wise, that we will be number one sometime soon. Me, as the Chief Network Officer, I can make this happen to become number one. I am so confident with that. And we believe that we have such a design ready to become number one in the market. And the network hours, this is the number of the hours are also increasing. This is awarded by the third party. And as a result, that the Sprint made the best improvements amongst all and also the customer acquisition, Marcelo is leading a team to make a big improvement here. Actually, we were facing the net loss every month. But now that we're seeing net adds every month churn ratio also stays low. As a result, operating revenue is now hit the bottom and at the same time cost reduction has been making a significant progress. Actually, the fixed cost annual basis, we were able to reduce by about \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level in the past four years. So, annual or fixed cost usually was about \\xc2\\xa53 trillion but now it went down to \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level. So, in the past four years EBITDA has been doubled. So, we made a complete turnaround. It was so challenging but now we're seeing the turnaround. As a result, operating income, it's been red in every year or every period, it's now making a big turnaround. And now, we are seeing operating income of \\xc2\\xa51.3 billion in nine months period. In U.S. history, this was the one of the biggest turnaround ever. So, it has been making a big loss and turning around this March is actually a very rare example I believe. Free cash flow is also making a big loss but now it's turned around and now showing the positive figures. Liquidity, many people said that it's almost bankrupting and no liquidity. But, here, as you can see, we have enough sufficient level even as of today that the people may think that the Sprint is dragging SoftBank's results, Sprint is the bottleneck for SoftBank. There are still such people in the market, maybe or almost half of the people thinks that Sprint is the bottleneck of the SoftBank. That's the kind of perceptions that people may have. But actually, the money that we spent for the acquisition of Sprint was \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion. Again, \\xc2\\xa51.9 trillion and that Sprint is now listed company. And, as of today, the Sprint's value is over \\xc2\\xa53 trillion now. So, that we've been suffered most after the acquisition of Sprint, but, actually, we have increased the value of Sprint, 58%, compared to the what we have spent in the acquisition. So, we have made more than \\xc2\\xa51 trillion here. Within a short and limited timeframe, this listed value or the equity value has increased by \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, so that Sprint is no longer the bottleneck. So, now that I believe this is the time you need to get rid of the perception that Sprint is the bottleneck of SoftBank, and I have more confidence. That is why we went through the acquisition of the ARM. That's why that we were able to make such a decision. So now that the Sprint is becoming not that bottleneck but now driver for the growth, and I've been telling you from these announced results. And as a result, that we came to the conclusion to acquire ARM. And on top of that, as a result from there, we are ready for the next game, which was to make decisions to set the form for the Vision Fund, so that Sprint is making a very good progress. Now, next is about ARM. ARM, I'm happy that I could acquire. I'm really, really happy that I could acquire ARM. SoftBank before ARM and SoftBank after ARM, that is just like SoftBank 1.0 and SoftBank 2.0. There's a major difference. SoftBank before ARM, what was it? In terms of number of users, the third largest telecom company in Japan. And though we see our profit margin maybe the top in the world in terms of absolute amount, in terms of the number of users, number three in Japan, number four in the U.S. Is there anything that we were number one? Yahoo Japan, maybe number one in Japan. But to be overwhelming number one in the world, I don't think we had such a benefit so far. But with ARM, finally, ever since the establishment of SoftBank, there is something that we can become the number one in the world and for the next 10, 20, or 100 years the most important business segment. In this segment, to be the overwhelmingly largest company, to be the top in the world is not possible. Everyone in the world is now using smartphones, and 99% of smartphones, I believe, uses ARM. It is difficult to find smartphone which is not based on ARM. With this position with ARM now, going forward with SoftBank 2.0, one very important strategy that we want to do, just like [indiscernible] (36:17) we are now able to take the corners of the world. But this is just the beginning of what I'm trying to do. Chip, in this nine months, 12.5 billion chips were shipped on an annual basis. This would be worth 16 billion or 17 billion units. Global population is 7 billion. So, everybody in the world, in one year per person, it means that everybody in the world bought more than two ARMs per year or 2.5 ARMs per year. In terms of global population, people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there are countries having difficulty in finding food. There are elderly people who \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or babies, people who never buy electronic products, but including that, it is 2.5 per capita in terms of global population. Having recognized of that, I bought 2.5 ARMs in one year. I don't think people would think that way in one year, in this year. But we are paying more than that every year. Because Japan is higher than the average of the world, so that is how much we are buying ARM. And ARM has not penetrated into the lifestyles of everybody in the world. We're accelerating R&D to increase investment. Don't ask me what is the purpose of the investment. We are now working towards SoftBank 2.0. We have started the preparations towards that. And to the future ARM 2.0, I will be personally involved in the strategy and business model. I'm now just making the strategy and business model. And in smartphones and home electric appliances or cars, ARMs are used, but not only that, supercomputers, next-generation supercomputers are using ARM. The next supercomputer of Japan, Post-K, will also be based on ARM. In Europe as well, the next-generation supercomputer will be based on ARM. All supercomputers in the world, models that will win the competition for supercomputers in the world are all based on ARM. ARM is not a mere small piece of chip, but even the world's supercomputers where horsepower is important, ARM is playing a role. So, I'm really, really happy that I could acquire ARM. And next, Alibaba. 16 years ago, I invested into Alibaba. 16 years ago, at the time, in making that investment. At the time, in Japan, the top leaders of the business circles in Japan, when I started investing in Chinese company, Alibaba, what is that company with the name of a robber. You can address China. You will feel, if you invest in China. So many people cautioned me, but at that time, I said, no, I don't agree. I respect you very much, but my opinion is entirely different from yours. It's entirely opposite from your opinion. I trust. I see things from the bright side. I don't see things from a critical point of view. I'm sure China will grow and Internet will grow in China, and China itself will also grow. So, I said I was aggressive. And as a result, it was good that I could make this investment. Alibaba has grown on to this size, both in terms of total revenue, year-on-year basis, the growth is 54%, and in terms of net income, growth is 36% of free cash flow. I said this is the important figure, 44% growth. Free cash flow in three months is more than \\xc2\\xa5500 billion, \\xc2\\xa5500 billion in three months. If you multiple it by four, how much is that? That is the current pace of growth. On top of that, the 44% growth. From the bottom of my heart, I'm very happy that I could invest on Alibaba, but this will still grow. And actually, it is continuing to grow. So, in the future, Alibaba will continue to be one of the core companies of SoftBank Group. New investment is OneWeb. What is OneWeb, you may wonder. So, I would like to touch on a little bit on the OneWeb for today. This is the next-generation low Earth orbit satellite communications company. So, here, we are to invest in hundred and some billion now that we are investing from SoftBank Group, but once that the fund is officially launched, then that is going to be investing from the fund. And the partner for the fund also agreed and eager to invest from the fund. Because of the time matters that we cannot really invest from the fund at this moment, but we would like to pick this company as a first investment from the fund. So, we have 36,000 kilometers away from the Earth, so that the 700 millisecond to 900 millisecond delay latency occurs. Not only the voice but also data communication also caused the latency, so not a quick response, but there are some kind of difficulty speaking. But that will come closer 30 times. So, the distance from the Earth is going to be 1/30. So that if you got closer, then the 700 millisecond to 900 milliseconds latency is going decrease to 20 milliseconds to 30 milliseconds. So, 20 milliseconds to 30 milliseconds meaning the distance latency is same as optical fiber. So, even from the space, but actually that you'll be able to realize the communication speed of LTE speed. So, I want you to see this video, please. So, here, you can see the earth over there. So, from 36,000 kilometers away from the Earth, you see this LEO satellites, so from these satellites that we are making a communication. That is why we are so far away and also make a lot of delays, too. So, that's why that is not convenient to use, but now this is coming closer by 1/30. So, if you come closer by 1/30, then you cannot cover with a limited number of satellites, so we need to increase the number of satellites first of all. And the number of satellites, we are talking about 700 to 800, which is the size about 1 meter, cheap and light, and that comes closer to the Earth. And there, if it's a vacuum status, noise is going to be decreasing and the communication is going to be even more better quality, so that the large-sized, low-latency communication is going to be happening here. The speed we are talking about is 200 megabit for downlink and 50 megabit bps for uplink. So, it's almost the same as optical fiber. So, ADSL or LTE for mobile or the cables, actually, we are talking about much, much faster speed here and also much, much less latency. So, we can do the broadband from the space. And when it comes to that, from airplane, ship or those far away distance place that we can make a connection or even in a very much [ph] suburban (45:53), those are the places where you didn't have a backbone in optical fiber or the disastrous areas, mountain areas, because from the space, you can make a connection. Here, in Japan, we have luxury of the optical fibers and it's available everywhere. As I mentioned earlier, SoftBank Hikari, now that connected to the home as well, but when you look at the world, you can already find the place where that has this much of luxury of optical fiber. Even in other city, if you go to the suburban area, not the optical fiber, but even cable is not connected. But if it comes from the sky, when it comes through the space, if you can enjoy the connection with the optical fiber level, how is that, or that we're connected to the base stations or you can connect it to the car. So, here, in the photo, it's like a van, but also the normal type of family car, on top of the roof that you can set the antenna to make a connection. So, the normal family cars. The photo is not very great here, but normal family cars or sedans will be able to mount with the antenna on top of the roof. So, wherever you go, you will be connected. And if this is the LTE base station, actually the roof of the car is going to become the LTE base station, so that it's not the ordinary satellite phone. You don't need to have a big, large, giant box, but inside of the car you'll be able to utilize whatever you use such as iPhone, the Android smartphone, it's going to be connected and you can talk. So, wherever you drive without any interference, you'll be able to speak if you go to the suburbans, if you go to the mountain area. But still, in the car, this is going to be used as a connected car. So, wherever you drive, you'll be able to be connected anytime. So, this is just one example. But with that I believe that the communication revolution is going to be happening here. So, me being as a telecom operator, we can make a connection to 98%, 99% but the last 1% coverage, last 2% coverage. Actually, about the same amount of CapEx is required to cover the 2%.The last 2%, the same amount as what we have spent in 98%. So, the cost efficiency is not too good, So, that is why the global telecom operator is actually giving up with the last 2%. That is why you cannot make a connection. But Japan, we never gave up, so that we are making much CapEx, so that we can make a connection everywhere. But, in average, if you look at the global telecom operator, they gave up on the last 10% of the coverage. But here if you can make a connection from the satellite, you can make a connection to the last 1%. In China, in one telecom operator, they spend about 2.3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some trillion yen annual basis in CapEx. U.S. operator, only one company, spend one-point-some-trillion yen for CapEx only in one year, \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion, \\xc2\\xa51.6 trillion I will say. This OneWeb, can you imagine how much CapEx is required to make a connection worldwide. In some of the fixed cost and CapEx for one year investment, how much do you think? Only one company, they are spending \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, \\xc2\\xa52 trillion for one year only for one country. For this case, to cover the global, the sum of the fixed cost and the CapEx is about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion level. So much cost efficient we are talking about here. If you can make that reasonable, why do you need a cable anymore? Why do you need optical fiber anymore? Why do you need Mobile Operation Backbone is needed in other way? Why we need that expensive connections to make a connected car? With this OneWeb that the way we would like to make another communication revolution, so that we will be connected to the people around the world and we will become the major shareholders of this company or we already are major shareholders of this company. And other than this, we made several investments and the track record in the past 18 years. Every year, we've been increasing the 44% of value. We are being profitable after the investment. You never see such a company around the world, I believe, with this size, with this rate. We believe that we are the only one who can achieve that. And people will ask me, you are lucky because of Alibaba. So, why don't we exclude Alibaba from here, 44% becomes only 43%, so 44% to 43%. Even excluding Alibaba, still we are achieving 43% of IRR. Then Sprint, which gave us a suffer or the SoftBank Mobile, those are the less growing powers compared to the others. If we include that, that would just give us 43% of IRR. Even excluding Alibaba 43%, even including Sprint, but still 43%, so no excuse at all, but still we are achieving 43% of IRR. So, we, as a business, operate our companies, which made the best margin ever. But also from the investment equal size, we are the global number one track record company. This is the story about the past, but with the SoftBank 2.0, what do we want to do? What's the most important part, which I mentioned in the beginning of this presentation. SoftBank has been making Internet revolution of PC and we were always making investment in the latest edge technology of PC world. So, one chip built it in PC and PC to PC connected and becomes the Internet. And with this PC Internet, we made the investment in the technology, run the operations and here we are. In the same chip, but not into the PC but now put it into smartphone, and smartphone to smartphone connection make us available with the mobile Internet. So that now that we are in mobile Internet revolution for that, we made acquisition of Vodafone K.K. And the core of this Internet or the core of this revolution is transferred from PC to mobile and now mobiles to PC \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, mobile to IoT. And every devices will be mounted with chip, and that will make another revolution of Internet. Also, some devices is going to be built with chip and that will connected to Internet and data is going to be accumulated in the cloud, and the data accumulated in the cloud is going to be used as a deep learning, so that data in the cloud is going to be utilized for AI. You can analyze and you can make an assumption, and that is going to be the singularity. In the process of singularity, most important or the core role is played by chip. And once that every device is going to connected to Internet, in IoT, and 90% of this IoT is now with ARM, most important revolution of Internet, revolution of information and the revolution of chip. And this chip, 90% of the global market is now using ARM. The smartphone area is already 99%, IoT 90% or over is going to be using ARM and that is the singularity. The chip actually the capability became a million times in 30 years. And I believe they will be making another million capability improvements in the coming 30 years. So, a million times capability will bring us all kinds of intelligence and the brains, human brains is going to be exceeded by the chip intelligence. And all sorts of industries is going to be redefined: medicals, automobiles, social infrastructures. All kinds of industry is going to be redefined. And there, there will be a chip and 90% of those chip is going to be connected with our ARM chip. And then there will be a big, big bang happening I expect. We saw a big bang in PC, we saw a big bang in Internet, and I believe the next big bang is going to be even bigger with IoT and singularity. Not probably everything but all sorts of industries, the chip is going to exceed human brain's intelligence, and that to be connected with wireless and connected in the cloud for super intelligence. Sorry to say a little bit aggressive things, but in coming 30 years, chip is going to be built in the shoes. So, the chip in the shoes going to exceed our brains. Actually, we're going to be less than a shoes going forward in the future. That's a little bit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sorry \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so, we're going to lose against this pair of shoes or the pair of glasses, all kinds of things. So, the chip in this pair of shoes itself may be a very small thing, but that chip is going to be connected to the cloud with wireless and there in the cloud it's going to make \\xe2\\x80\\x93 use it for the deep learning. Then in the big picture, in a total system, so many things is going to be smarter than the brain and, again, the whole industry is going to be redefined. And then, now that Uber is redefining the car service market; Airbnb is redefining the hotel industry; Google is redefining the search industry; Steve Jobs, with smartphone, redefined the mobile phone or cellphone, such redefinition \\xe2\\x80\\x93 redefine is going to be happening in all kinds of industries and all kinds of lifestyles. So, this big bang is going to be much, much bigger big bang than the past big bang as if that the past big bang is just about the practice for this time big bang. And to be ready for that or ready for that age, we need to set the foundation, and that foundation is SoftBank Vision Fund. So, that kind of conclusion I came to based on the preparations for the big bang. So, this fund is not the short-term investment, short-term return for 3%, 4%, 5%, something like that. It's totally not that thing. Usually, 20% to 40% of share owning and become the major shareholder. Also, we will be on the boat. And together with the entrepreneurs, together with the management, we would like to discuss the strategy, we would like to discuss the business plan, so that we can create the organic partnerships or strategic group, and that will be the best way to set the group. So, with the same \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we can share the same vision and create a group. In the past, the group companies or the family companies or the blood relationship or the brand sharing, that's a kind of very traditional way in Japanese companies in the past. But in that case, those group companies not necessarily the number one company in the market. Number one in automobile, number one in chemical, number one in tires, there are no such companies that make all number one. So, it's like a number five, number three and number four, sometimes number one company, that's a kind of a group company. Then you have to make some compromise there. Because this is a group company, you are not a number one in this market, but we have to use you because we are the group company, that kind of compromise happens. But we are not that way. We are not stick to the brand or blood or nationality. Whatever your \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you are potentials to become number one, you'll be the strategic group company and we will make a synergy. That's why we are strong. And once we made a success, we can exit. And that's why that we can create the very strong and potential group. So, it's not only the investment and the return groups, but we share the strategy, we share the vision and we set up the group. So, that's the kind of a new way of our new system, which we didn't see in the past in the world. And we are creating \\xe2\\x80\\x93 SoftBank is creating such a new way of strategic group. The first system in the world, so that they may be difficult to understand, but I believe we will be able show you the very new SoftBank. It's not a venture capital. SoftBank Vision Fund is actually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but there are about $6.5 billion is the kind of a total sum of the venture capital amount. So, that's $6.5 billion. But here we're talking about $100 billion only by one SoftBank Vision Fund. So, actually that we are bigger than some of the Vision Fund in worldwide. So, that's something that we're trying to create. And why? because we want to make people happy with Information Revolution. So, with this philosophy, we gather together and that is SoftBank. It became a little bit vague and it's not the ordinary earnings results announcement, but I hope you understand what do we want to do, and I hope you share the same understanding. Thank you very much. That is all for me. \",\n",
       " '2016 Q4': \"My name is, Son. Thank you very much for coming today. Just about 10 years ago, SoftBank was making a lot of negative numbers. And we just launched Yahoo! BB and that was the time, now that we may be able to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we might be able to start making a profit. But that time that we are all negative. And that time, at the shareholders' meeting, we have received a lot of questions from shareholders, what's happening next. Where the SoftBank is going? That kind of question came in. And I said, we will grow. We would grow. We will improve. That's something that I answer. And that time, I said you may hear this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you might hear this as a kind of a big dream and maybe you need to discount 100%. That was my assumptions that I said. Someday, in profit, we would like to record \\xc2\\xa51 trillion or \\xc2\\xa52 trillion, so we would like to count our profitability in trillion level. That's something that I said. So I said I'm a big dreamer and that was a big stream. That was the kind of a thing that I mentioned to the shareholders. And there, actually, in both operating income and the EBITDA that we are exceeding \\xc2\\xa51 trillion finally, so that's something that I wanted to announce to you first of all. At the same time, actually, I just received a question, how you feel about the profitability of the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So, I kind of asked myself how do I think about this. Actually, I didn't have any special feeling. Actually, it's strange that I didn't feel any special feeling. \\xc2\\xa51 trillion profit, I didn't really have anything in my heart. Why? I just thought about that and because I don't feel kind of achievement with this \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. It is just a point to go through. That's why I don't really feel the achievement yet. That's how I just thought about this result at this time. This is just a number and number is number. But even more importantly, what we are aiming for, where we are going to and how big are we going to grow? That's the kind of more important thing for me. So, once again, just about two years ago, I would like to kind of recap what I said in two years ago. So, SoftBank, I said it's a goose that lays the golden eggs or not. That was the kind of a discussion I did at the earnings results announcement two years ago. And today, after two years since then, how we position right now, that's something that I would like to share with you, how we are doing with this. So, our consolidated results here. Net sales, adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and net income, all as you can see that these are the numbers. I'm going to one-by-one. In net sales, 0.2% increase and as you can see the breakdown of those. If you see on a dollar base, 11% increase. The reason is because Sprint in dollar base that they are growing. But because of the impact of stronger yen, it looks a little bit decreased. So, Sprint probably we should see in dollar base. For the Domestic Telecom, we should see in yen base. So, we are kind of in the mixture of those two, that's the kind of real strength of ours. In adjusted EBITDA, this is 1% up. As you can see, it is making a steady growth and keep growing. Again, the dollar base \\xe2\\x80\\x93 breakdown of the adjusted EBITDA. And as you see at the dollar base actually increased by 23%. As you can see, the driver for the growth is actually now Sprint. Many of you have thought Sprint is actually dragging our growth. Actually, it's becoming the bottleneck for the SoftBank. That's the kind of image it may have. But by a year ago, I have started saying that Sprint is now becoming turning around. It is showing the sign now that we will be seeing Sprint as growth engine. That's something that I actually pre-informed you about a year ago, and now you see the actual result from there. And EBIT, 13% increase and the breakdown, here it is. As you can see, even more clear. The biggest driver for the EBIT is now Sprint. The yellow portion, Sprint is growing. That's even more clearer when you see the breakdown of EBIT. And if you put it in dollar base, 27% increase. So, actually you see that even more impact or contribution to the EBITDA by Sprint. So, either you see in yen base or dollar base, like I said earlier, Sprint, I think we should see in dollar base. And for Domestic Telecom, we should see in Japanese yen base. So, I think the real capabilities of ours actually in the middle of those. And I mentioned about \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. About two years ago, SoftBank \\xe2\\x80\\x93 maybe it was three years ago, on the number wise, actually, we achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion once. But back then, that was the time we had revaluation in the one-time gain of \\xc2\\xa5250 billion from the GungHo. And if we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 probably, we do need to exclude GungHo and Supercell from there. So it was not the real power \\xe2\\x80\\x93 real capability of ours. But there was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that also was important once we achieved, then it can be a good track record. So, once that you achieve the one place then you will be able to come back to that once again, so that's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was a kind of a one-time gain for the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion achievement. But at this time, it's the real capability. So next year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the past few years, although we haven't shown the guideline or guidance for the business performance for the next fiscal year, but in EBIT next year, I am confident that we are going to exceed \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. And actually we will be able to increase the number from this year because Domestic Telecom is making steady growth and on top of that, Sprint is making a good growth and actually is becoming a growth engine. So from that we believe we will be able to exceed \\xc2\\xa51 trillion at this year's result or next fiscal year for sure. So, when you look at Japanese operating companies, those companies who exceeded or achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion in EBIT was only three companies including ourselves. So, NTT Group and Toyota was the only company that achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. And actually NTT spends about 118 years to achieve \\xc2\\xa51 trillion EBIT. They were originally the 100% state run company and they were kind of exclusive over 100 years or so in the business. And Toyota was a second company to achieve \\xc2\\xa51 trillion EBIT. And we are the third company and actually we spent shorter number of years to achieve this. And in net income, this is first time to exceed \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. Here, of course, we do include the one-time gain. So whether we have achieved \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, this is not the real capability, but you can kind of consider this as a kind of a discount basis. But actually, in EBIT, we have to steadily achieve and we have a confidence to be able to achieve \\xc2\\xa51 trillion EBIT, meaning that we will be able to go the same direction in the net income as well. So this is not only the one-time hit and we believe this is going to be kind of our own strength. And in operating company who achieved the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion net income, it was only Toyota so far in Japanese companies. So, we are the second company as operating company in Japan. And still, some people say SoftBank is too much debt. Our financial position is not good. So when it comes to debt or financial status, maybe we should put in this way. The Domestic Telecom, based on Domestic Telecom, based on that success that we decided to acquire Sprint, and we have raised the debt to acquire Sprint. So, including that acquisition financing, we have a net interest-bearing debt of \\xc2\\xa53.6 trillion and EBITDA is \\xc2\\xa51.2 trillion, so the multiple is about 3 times. And other businesses, well, those are our holdings, and the market cap is about \\xc2\\xa518 trillion and for that \\xc2\\xa54.4 trillion for net interest-bearing debt. So, asset that we have, the 25% of the total asset borrowings there, which is a very healthy line that I can say and 3 times leverage ratio, how do you look at that? When you compare with the major mobile operators in Europe and United States, so these are the debt-to-EBITDA ratio and 3 times is not the abnormal number or anything. It's about the medium compared to the other peers. And for me, zero debt may be seen as a healthy thing. But for the company who is still keep growing, may not be utilizing its own capability fully. So, that's how I feel. So that's why \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so still that like I said that the major mobile operators in Europe and U.S. compared with those peers that we are in the medium. Moving on to Domestic Telecom business. So this is doing very well and that is why we have been able to source ourselves in acquiring Sprint. So, how are we trending at this point? EBIT at this point is almost \\xc2\\xa5720 billion and we are growing steadily. It is, we are able to stabily run this business. And so, the EBIT grew by 5%. And the EBITDA margin to sales, how is that going? It is 55%. And so, it really tells you that we are steadily are becoming stronger in running this business because we are able to generate more margin now. If we compare ourselves to some of the major players, we can say that we are global number one. Usually, network and infrastructure business, you'll look at a larger market share companies and these are the ones who usually have higher margin. However, in our case, maybe size wise we're not number one in Japan. However, in terms of margin, we are number one in the world. That's something I would clearly like to mention here. Looking at the subscribers at the moment, little-by-little, yes, but still steadily we are able to grow the number. And at the same time, we have Yahoo! BB and we have ADSL broadband and starting this communication telecom business. But now, we are going into optic fiber, that's our main focus now. Compared to 12 months ago, the subscribers' households have doubled. And so, now we are steadily generating profit. And so, again, Domestic Telecom business, looking into free cash flow, we have been able to improve our sales by 40% year-on-year, and this is after CapEx and after tax. And when you look into financial accounting, of course, there are many ways to measure how you are doing. And for instance, you'd be able to look into domestic or overseas GAAP, you'd be able to look into various metrics. It could be EBIT. It could be other profit. But then it's really about how you look at it. But the fact is this free cash flow, how much free cash flow do you have shows the fact. After all tax. After all CapEx, how much free cash do you have, free cash flow? We have been able to increase it up to \\xc2\\xa5561 billion size we initially had been saying that our target is going to be \\xc2\\xa5500 billion, but in the midst of the year we revised our target upwards. But we're now able to exceed even that revised target, and so we are very happy. So again, the ratio of free cash flow towards revenue. Again, here, we are number one globally, 23%. This tells that we are top company in the world in generating free cash out of the revenue. In other words, compared to other mobile players, other peers, we are most efficient in generating free cash flow out of the revenue. And so, again, for the 13th consecutive times, we have been able to grow our revenue and profit. And even in this year, we're able to generate the same level of free cash flow in a very steady and healthy manner and a very stable manner as well. And we're also aiming to expand more synergies with Yahoo! Japan for the domestic side. Next, I'd like to move on to Sprint. I said earlier that Sprint is no longer our burden. It is going to be a growth driver. It's going to be a growth engine for our Softbank Group from here. Again, net additions, we have been able to more than double vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis last year. And the churn rate has become best in Sprint history now. The revenue had gone down a bit at one point of time, but we have been able to improve ourselves. And the cost, we have been able to do better here. In other words, we have been able to do $3.4 billion amount reduction in two years. So, that would be like \\xc2\\xa5370 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or \\xc2\\xa5380 billion amount. So, compared to two years ago, the annual \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or this is I guess the different way to look at this. But again, the total would be \\xc2\\xa5380 billion. And in terms of fixed cost, I'm sure there are various ways to look at it, but then again the annual fixed cost. We have been able to reduce it by over \\xc2\\xa5100 billion compared to this a couple of years ago. And so, therefore, we have been able to double our EBITDA in four years. So it's almost $1 trillion. And so, we have been able to come to an EBITDA level very close to what we're doing in Japan. Operating income therefore vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis last year, we have been able to grow it by 6 times. And so you can find that we are actually generating operating income. So, that would be approximately \\xc2\\xa5200 billion amount of operating income. It is positive by \\xc2\\xa5200 billion. Adjusted free cash flow has also turned around to become positive. And there was one point of time when Sprint was having a lot of debt and there were lots of rumors. And we would say, our market was also concerned that Sprint may not be able to pay all its debts. And looking into next year, at this point, we're even thinking we may have too much cash. About a month ago, I had been speaking with CFO of Sprint. What are you doing? You're having too much cash. Look at the interest rate. The interest rate is going to cost us. Sure, try to go steadily, safely is good, but interest rate is going to be a cost. In other words, we currently are really almost cash heavy. And so, the amount of bonds of Sprint, the rate itself has gone down in the market. And of course, a lot of people, we often times discuss about why not buy it back now, so that's final thought. But the business itself, the important thing is network. And network, right after the acquisition of Sprint. Sprint network was terrible. Network was really \\xe2\\x80\\x93 did a poor and it was not connecting at all. But now, finally, in nationwide in the United States, amongst the all voice performance became number two by the survey of the third party. And on top of that, even made me happy was that we became number one in the metro areas. And this, we will be able to improve region-by-region, market-by-market. So, voice first of all is becoming better and better. And, now its data LTE connectivity is also another key, and we have a rich spectrum. And also, we have brought innovative tools. So first of all, spectrum, we have [ph] affluent (21:54) 2.5 gigahertz compared to any other operators in the world. At least, in advanced country, we have the most 2.5 gigahertz, and that is going to be the good, big blip on for Sprint. So far, 2.5 gigahertz is a high spectrum so that is not really coming to the indoors or coming into the building, so that was regarded as an issue. But with this High Power UE, the new standard has been proposed by us, and now that has been accepted by the industry. So we have also encouraged China Mobile, OPPO or Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei, with those companies that we would like to set up this as kind of a new standard for the industry and utilizing 2.5 gigahertz TD-LTE that we will be able to have more power from the end user handset. So, that was a new industry standard. As a result, the distance or the reach from the base station has been expanded. So, a 2.5 gigahertz \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually, compared with 1.9 gigahertz, which is mid band that actually showed the same coverage of 1.9 gigahertz. So 99% of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1.9 gigahertz of the coverage, it can be also covered by 2.5 gigahertz. Speed and performance, everything is going to be improved with that. And on top of that, we have created \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there are so many variety of innovative tools. I myself, as a Chief Network Officer of Sprint, I've been involved heavily in the development of these tools and we came up with the new weapon of Sprint, unique weapon. And that is going to be used for the small cell of Sprint. And that when we come into 5G \\xe2\\x80\\x93 fifth generation network, that this is a kind of a preparation for that. So the bigger 5G is going to be needed to deploy in small cells because 5G is the high band network. So, it's not something that you would be able to do with a big tower to make the coverage. So, with the small cell and make the big \\xe2\\x80\\x93 lots of places and roll-out nationwide is going to be the case and we are most advanced in terms of that and we've been starting the initiative in Sprint. And one of the tool is called Magic Box that we have invented. This is going to be also very much useful for 5G. So this is going to be installed in many places, inside of the building and also the outside as well, so not only for the indoor coverage but also the coverage at the outside as well. So that is going to be the kind of a good preparations for the good ground for the 5G advance as well. So that has been already \\xe2\\x80\\x93 had a trial in metro areas and suburban areas. And at the first trial, we have chosen six markets to set up the Mini Macro Magic Box and so on. And this is kind of the results from those six trials in markets. New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Denver and Indianapolis and Houston. And those six areas and actually five out of six markets, we have already achieved a number one position. For example, New York in this test area that we have experienced and as a result speed of download or the overall performance, we hit the number one. San Francisco was also the same. Chicago also the same number one, Denver number one. So, we have been making a real performance to make Sprint number one. So that is going to be rolled out through the nationwide of the United States. So that what we have prepared is now be ready and available for the market, commercial market. So I am so confident to be able to make further success. And actually, we just announced today that this is the first time in the world that 5G was actually been told or people say that is 2020, but we will be the first and the fastest to be able to address 5G in 2019. So, actually it was a 39 GHz wave high band is going to be used for the 5G. But actually the best and good for indoor which is 2.5 gigahertz with High Power UE, we will be utilizing 2.5 gigahertz to address communication network and handset for 5G, and that's to be prepared, which we agreed to initiate that with Qualcomm today. And that's going to be a very big milestone for us. Sprint is going to be the most advanced network and the most advanced 5G network is going to be created. So, number one network is going to be coming real by Sprint to aim for the number one position in United States. And that will make Sprint even more exciting for me. And recently, Sprint also announced the earnings results and I myself was also joined the conference call and talked about the network area like I just mentioned, and at the very end of the call, there were so many questions and I was ready. But because the operator disconnected by mistake, and right before I started talk something, the call was disconnected and the call ended before I rejoined. And there are things that I couldn't say, so that I would like to talk about that for this opportunity and I would like to make some comments about that. The question that I was asked during that call was about Sprint, about the industry consolidation. There are so many talks and speculations in the United States. And with new administration, there was a question about how SoftBank think about Sprint. And that was a question for me, but because time was up, so that I couldn't answer. But what I prepared to say was that with this new administration, compared to the previous administration, industry consolidation maybe even more open minded, and that they are ready to listen with open mind. That's how I hear so far. In previous administration, the door was completely closed. They don't have a ear to listen at all, so they were quite tough on business actually. So that was the United States in a previous administration. I was not happy and not very much motivated that moment, but with the new administration, not the regulations to rule the business, but it's going to be even more or open for the business activities. And for the industry consolidation, I believe there will be more and more options available in the market, but up until the last month end, there was a spectrum auction going on in United States, so that between the operators, we should not be making any discussions that was strongly, strongly advised by the legal counsel. So that any of the operators should not be talking each other and we did not talk each other. But now that this 600-megahertz spectrum auction completed and now that there, we are okay to start discussing with each other. And now, we are entering this space of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 allows the discussion between the operators. So, from now on I would like to explore variety of possibilities regarding the industry consolidation going forward. And that's something that I wanted to say. How that will be is also up to the counterpart. And also that's going to be up to negotiation. So I cannot discuss any in detail at this moment. But at least I believe that door is open. And we would like to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 without any restriction that we would like to explore any possible options available. Next, Yahoo going very steadily. Advertising revenue is growing steadily. Yahoo! Shopping, we're finding growth here. Compared to the peers, the shopping platform, the number of merchants have become 10 times more compared with our peers. I said about e-commerce revolution for AI and within the four years, we have been able to increase the number of merchants by 25 times. So, you can find that vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis comparison of last year. Actually, Yahoo! Shopping is the strongest growing e-shopping platform in Japan. And at this point, we are able to find even more momentum in growth. Next ARM. I am very glad that we were able to obtain ARM now. And I was able to also announce about 5G. And I just said that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I commented about it earlier. And I have been able to say that we're going to be able to go ahead of everyone in the world, and that's because we have been able to acquire ARM. And because we have been able to acquire ARM. The Qualcomm CEO is now able to speak to me directly. And if I want to meet Qualcomm CEO, I can speak with him any time. This is because the technology partner, the best technology partner for Qualcomm happens to be ARM. ARM chips is in 99% of smartphones. The 99% of smartphones, modems would contain ARM chips. And so, again, Qualcomm sees ARM as the best technology partner, and that's why we can speak with each other any time. We not only do this communication business in Japan, but we also do this in the U.S. And so, therefore, if you add that two markets together, we're able to offer this type of communication service in the two largest markets in the world, Japan and the U.S. And this happened to be the two markets that would have lots of chips being used, and you can find there's a significant Qualcomm communication technology and the business operator. If you look at this from these two perspectives, we're trying to put an alliance into these two approaches. And Qualcomm is now calling to us for more alliance and cooperation. Again, 2.5 gigahertz Band 41. We're now in the most advanced position in being able to offer 2.5 gigahertz. And so, this strategic partnership, we're able to go into the strategic partnership ahead of everyone else, and this is because we have ARM. And this ARM has been able to grow the revenue by 8% vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis last year. And ARM-based chip is increasing by 17%. On \\xc2\\xa5100 billion amount of chips shipped \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xc2\\xa5100 billion was shipped around the world, and it took 26 years before ARM would be able to achieve that \\xc2\\xa5100 billion. But, it's probably just going to be the next four years when we'd be able to go to \\xc2\\xa5200 billion cumulative base. It took 26 years to achieve the first \\xc2\\xa5100 billion, but now we're having this accelerated growth and it's just going to be four years to achieve \\xc2\\xa5200 billion. And so, therefore, again, ARM, we need to look further ahead into the world of IoT. We need to accelerate more. Nothing has been achieved at this point. ARM, it's not that much of a CapEx, capital expenditure. Most expenditure in ARM is about headcounts, labor cost because it's these talents that we need to invest in, it's the talents that count in ARM. And so, that is why we're going on the offensive and increasing the number of headcounts by 21%. ARM, we're having more acceleration in business, Arm DynamIQ. We are trying to redefine multi-core and this is something that I'd like to announce. So again, this new single cluster design with reduced latency with optimal performance. So, again, we're able to redefine multi-core. Now, AI can be found anywhere. And to make sure we had AI adoption everywhere, Arm DynamIQ has been designed. And so, there is 50 times more boost in performance, 10 times more quicker response. And so there's dedicated processor for AI and that's what ARM DynamIQ is doing and we should be able to see many more ARM DynamIQ and several billion units around the world from hereof. The number of smartphones around the world, it pretty much has matured. And so, some people would say, because we have enough smartphones, maybe we may no longer see increase in ARM shipments. But compared to smartphone shipments increase, look at other royalty revenue for ARM side. This is because ARM is able to offer more high value-adding type of chips every year. It's more high function. And so, therefore, more functions can be added. And that is why this royalty revenue is growing by 18% year-on-year. And we're not just talking about terminals now, even data centers. It was very much dominated by Intel, but ARM is now really going into this space as well. Last day, Microsoft, I mentioned that it is also going to Microsoft PC terminal. But not only that, it is also going into Microsoft data centers. So, Microsoft, we're going to have ARM deployed in over half of Microsoft data center servers. And in IoT, we have Amazon Echo, we have Fitbit, iRobot. And so, IoT is going to be prevalent everywhere. We're going to see an explosive growth within the next two decades. We're going to see a high number of ARM chips being deployed, more than trillion level and this speed is going to be accelerated from here. And so again, it's not just about purchasing a terminal to sell. It's not just about investing for a terminal to deploy. We're trying to become \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we're trying to 100% absorb the growth driver of the industry itself, be itself, within the IT industry, within the Internet industry. ARM is very much a critical part in the growth, and now we have ARM. And so, this goes back to the Qualcomm example. Qualcomm example is just one example of what we have been able to do. But I think there is a great significant in holding ARM. So, up to here is a business performance, so like I mentioned \\xc2\\xa51 trillion, \\xc2\\xa52 trillion is not something impressive for me anymore. It is just one milestone to go through. Well, as I just mentioned in the beginning, is SoftBank a goose that lays the golden eggs. Two years ago, when I say that, people were not really getting it. What I am talking \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what does he talking about? So, the golden egg itself has a value, but that goose has value as well. That's a kind of a question. So, in the past few years, goose \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what kind of performance this goose did, is something that I would like to share with you. In the past two years, we increased the debt, net interest bearing debt increased by \\xc2\\xa52 trillion. It's a kind of SoftBank loves that, that's people told me. But as a result, it did increase by \\xc2\\xa52 trillion, that's the fact. But at the same time as a result, so this is a kind of the food for goose. So, goose actually ate a lot, but as a result of eating a lot some of the parts that SoftBank has. Those companies at SoftBank, the market cap of those, in two years ago, it was \\xc2\\xa518 trillion, but now that increased to \\xc2\\xa525 trillion, so increased by \\xc2\\xa57 trillion. So, we spent \\xc2\\xa52 trillion more food for goose. But as a result, we have \\xc2\\xa57 trillion increase in the asset of SoftBank. Wasn't that a good thing? That was not a bad thing, wasn't it? So the asset that we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the value of the asset increased. So, if we list net interest bearing debt, which will give us the shareholders' value, and that has increased to \\xc2\\xa517 trillion from \\xc2\\xa512 trillion, so it increased by \\xc2\\xa55 trillion. So, market cap is recorded by valuation from the market. So, \\xc2\\xa59.5 trillion is the current valuations by the market. So \\xc2\\xa59 trillion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but the value of the golden eggs, this then gives you \\xc2\\xa517 trillion compared to two years ago, actually we increased by \\xc2\\xa55 trillion. It's not only the one way increase. There are ups and downs. But in 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10 years, actually, golden goose is increasing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 relatively speaking, it's increasing. So, you can count one golden egg for \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So, 10 years ago, there was zero. It was actually \\xc2\\xa51 trillion. So, zero golden eggs, after ups and downs mainly increasing trends and now achieving 17 golden eggs. So, SoftBank maybe able to change the normal eggs to golden eggs by eating a lot. And that may change the eggs, normal eggs to golden eggs, for example, Alibaba, Yahoo!, Supercell, Vodafone, Sprint. Even Sprint, we spend our leverage and increase the equity value. So, this was actually the feeding cost, so that minimize equity price. And there, we improved our equity value, which shows in the IRR. So, in an annualized basis, it's like 81% or 40%, something like that that's increasing. You may think that this is only the good examples. But if we make it all total, taking the debt out of the equity value, that cumulative investment was \\xc2\\xa51.5 billion and that became \\xc2\\xa5170 billion, so 15 times, so in IRR, increasing by 44% in annual basis. With this size, I may think that you may manage the fund by, you may be the analyst. But average growth of 44% is not something that you can see all the time. I personally don't buy and sell the SoftBank's share in principal other than SoftBank share, so I focus on SoftBank only. If I'm the individual investor or the institutional investor, I may be able to give you the best performance ever. But I'm not going to be playing the small games like that. I just like to play the big game like this to move the \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level of the money, so that with a combined basis, we are increasing or growing 44%, no excuse. As a result, \\xc2\\xa517 trillion is the market cap of the assets that we hold taking out the debt of the \\xc2\\xa58 trillion. And the goose here, so goose increasing the golden eggs like I showed. Actually, I believe that the goose has more value than golden eggs. I don't know how do you think about this, but actually I believe real value stays in the goose, not in the golden eggs. So, the goose that's laying the golden eggs every year is actually the most important and valuable. In Aesop's story, goose lays an egg per day and the greedy men wanted to have a golden egg, and couldn't wait for the egg per day. So, the greedy men killed goose and open up his belly and couldn't get any golden egg at all. SoftBank, we always feed to goose. As I said, this is the debt. We increase the debt, but actually the goose laid eggs instead, so that we don't have to rush to decrease the debt so early. I wanted to remind you the story of Aesop So, this is the past. So I can just don't need to talk about the past. Actually, it's important to talk about the future. SoftBank can evolve even further with the SoftBank Vision Fund we were going to grow and evolve. Why we are setting up this fund, is because we have a vision. There is a motivation we want to do something. And I've just been using the word of golden eggs. But after the Internet industry started like Amazon, Google, Facebook, so many heroes are coming out to the market. It's like a gold rush, golden rush in increasing the enterprise value here and there in the past 10 years. But me, I don't believe that has end yet. Gold rush, golden rush, actually starts now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 up until now, it's just about the preparation time because Internet that we've been using as a business model, data was created by human through the platform used for the advertisement model or charging model. That was an Internet business model. And here that has a Facebook, Google, Yahoo! Japan and so on. So basically, the data was created by human and that was through the platform to monetize. But going forward, it's not the data only from people, but things we will create the data. So, many of the things will be in the Internet, and those things will create the data through the big data, through artificial intelligence. And data is going to be the biggest asset. So, as the biggest asset, super intelligence is going to be created. So the data that 90% of the IoT the things actually built it in with ARM-based chip sets, and data will be created through the ARM-based chip and that goes to big data. So actually, we took all the four corners, and that's something that we have done by the acquisition of ARM. So, all the industry is going to be redefined. For example, transportation has been defined by Uber and Didi, same applies to many industry: healthcare or to food, agriculture, productions, so many older industry is going to be redefined. So the real golden rush is now coming. Hundreds of tons of data compared to the human made is going to be created and utilized by the AI. And I cannot wait for that. I cannot miss that opportunity. About the year 2000, after the collapse of Internet bubble, I thought that that was the time that we should go for it. And then people called me crazy. So people said that they shouldn't look at my eyes or something like that. But that time, we see both. I think we have been able to get the best of the return. But now, I think we are entering into the real golden rush. If we had money back then that was different, but now that we are also entering into the real golden rush, so then we do need to prepare the money without increasing our debt and Vision Fund is for that. SoftBank Vision Fund is the kind of a base and preparation for the real golden rush. Without increasing debt, so the goose is eating a lot, debt is increasing and people worries about the goose. So without increasing debt, even feeding goose, but still not increasing debt. But that changed the form to the firms and invite the partners and spend for the investment. As a result, goose is now even flying away not just walking around in the garden. Now, it's the time to jump. It's now time to fly. And now flying, it becomes the gold goose. So we are flying away with a gold goose. I think I don't believe that the many company does this kind of a story in the earnings result. But you cannot be too strict, and you cannot think small. It is just a one-time life and now that we are facing the one-time golden rush. So that's why we should be kind of open up our mind, open up our heart and think big, that's something I would like to do. So that concludes my speech which may not be suitable for the earnings results announcement. But I hope that you eat a lots of eggs or use and every time you eat eggs, please think about me. Thank you very much.\",\n",
       " '2017 Q1': \"My name is Son from SoftBank. Thank you very much for joining today. This week, I am facing my birthday at the age of 60. At the age of 19, I came up with a 50-year plan for the life, and that was with me for these years. And I've been publicly talking, speaking about this plan to my close friends, and after then we founded a business with SoftBank, and I've been consistently keeping this promise: 20s, come up with the business, 30 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the 30s that we raised the money and the 40s that we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 50s that we'd like to reform the business and 60s to transfer to the next generation. Those are my promise for a 50-year plan and I never changed my plan since then. And I am now having this my birthday at 60. So I said that I will be transferring or succeeding to the next generation at the age of 60s, not 60. So, could be from 60 to 69. So, between the 10 years of those that I would like to appoint the successor of mine and of that business. And now that I am entering into this 60s this week, SoftBank has been \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has SoftBank been able to establish the business model or not? I believe the announcement of the Vision Fund or the form in the Vision Fund has helped us to create the formation that we've been aiming for as a SoftBank Group. And I will say at least we were able to establish the base or the form for that to some extent. Business has not been completed yet. Of course, it is going be more to come. That's how I feel. However, having said that, the base or the form for that business, or the direction of the business has been clarified in which that I would like to talk about my business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our business including Vision Fund. And this will be the first earnings announcement that I include the Vision Fund's result as well. I had a little bit of a sore throat, so sorry about my voice. This morning, I just went to the doctor, went to see a doctor. So, I've been \\xe2\\x80\\x93 said that I am not the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 any issues but still I have some sore throat so that I cannot really make too much big voice, so sorry about that. It will be cured, but still I'm having a little bit problem with my throat. So, I would like to be calm and a little bit quiet than the usual. Sorry, about that. So, I would like to start with the consolidated results. As you can see, net sales, adjusted EBITDA, EBIT, net income as you can see on the slide, and I would like to go one by one. First, net sales. As we can see, EBITDA, again, in the breakdown of the adjusted EBITDA here, Sprint is making a good growth amongst these EBITDA segments. In EBIT, starting from this term, we are including SoftBank Vision Fund for consolidated results. So, this will be the first \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is the first earnings announcement including SoftBank Vision Fund under our consolidation. And you see that the Visual Fund's number is included here, and the breakdown is like this: On the very top, the dark blue is the SoftBank Vision Fund business, and the yellow below that is from Sprint. About a year ago, at that time, Sprint was recording red and still those moment that the people were worried and anxious about Sprint may go bankrupt. And I said that about 12 months ago, I started speaking that Sprint's future is bright. And actually, I start having good confidence in Sprint. Two, three years ago, I said that we have a long way to go and that we are still dark way to go. And I once wished to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I wanted to sell all the business. That was my own honest opinion. But however, since then, about 12 months ago, I start having confidence in Sprint business, and I thought \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and after then, also I start having confidence that the Sprint can be a growth engine for the business overall. So, people who heard about me saying that I am being more confident about Sprint and people said I am just making a big mouth and no base for that explanation. That's the people's mind and the people were not really believing what I said. But as you can see this slide, now you know. Sprint is actually making a big growth in EBIT and actually is coming closer to the domestic telecom about a year ago or two years ago. How many of you have told that Sprint would make this type of big turnaround? Even now here in this venue, people may say that there may be some kind of window dressing. Was Sprint really making a turnaround? There are many people wish to think that way or are still thinking that way but as a reality here, Sprint is actually the leading driving force for our profit and they're actually reborn to such a great company. That's something that I want you to understand and I want you to realize. So they are saying that if you don't see three days and that you need to see that, there will be a different person but now Sprint has turned around and it will continue. That's how what I want you to think about and our net income 98% down. This is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I believe that there will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you may want to use this number for the headlines of your newspaper and you can do that too, of course, because this is a fact. This is a fact however want you to also understand the background what is happening here. Actually, last year, same time, we had a one-time gain on sales of Alibaba share, and this year, we didn't sell. Why did we sell last year? It was because we wanted to acquire ARM. That was the main reason why. And this was the preparation for the ARM acquisition, and we did have some sales of Alibaba share. So, it was like a forward selling. So, it was not a block selling, but actually, that transaction will be completed two years ahead. And we received the cash in advance. So, we haven't sold it, but we received money, at least we have sold the share, and the cash came in, in advance. In that moment, the way that we have structured was that once share price goes up that there'll be a loss in derivatives. That was the structure for the instrument. And because of the structure, the higher the share price goes, that would be more advantageous for us. But accounting-wise, over three years, that will give us a loss in derivatives from the accounting's way. So, it does not mean any cash out, just a matter of process of accountings. So, without that derivative loss and once \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bring this back, then that actually the net income was 61% increase. Is that going to be really come back? So, two years later from now, that will be coming back, accounting-wise. How that's going to come back? It's like this. About a year ago, we had derivative transactions. We have but a little bit of down in derivative, share price up, then that we have gain on derivative. But once the share goes up, then we have a derivative loss. We do record a derivative loss. However, about two years later, which is the year after next year, if the share price stays at today, then we will expect to see the valuation gain for about \\xc2\\xa5400 billion so that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as long as the share price stays as of the month June 30, then we will have a grow back of derivatives later on, and we will have a gain on accounting wise. And on top of that, we will have a gain on sales of Alibaba share. So, if today is three years later of today, then we have already close to \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level of the gain is with us. So, actually that is the positive factor for us. So, this comes up every quarter basis, and I explain about the derivative every time, but actually this is not really difficult to understand. So that there are some people still that does not understand. Is this derivative loss really loss for the company? Actually, this is not a loss. Only for the accounting procedure-wise, this is expressed as a derivative loss. However, we will come back. So the amount three years later will be called back. So that it's like a deemed gain. So, once you recall loss, you have higher loss, then you see more gain on the pink bar here later on. That is the case. It's a little bit complicated transaction. Structure may not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 may be difficult to understand so that you may feel that we are making some tricks or something. But that's misunderstanding. Actually, accounting-wise, it's \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually, we have recording loss ahead. And that will be called back later. So, accounting-wise, as I mentioned earlier, it is 98% down for net income for this term, and that is the right process, right procedures for the accountings. As of today, however, in reality, effectively, it is up 61% in the loss from the derivative, we will come back later on. And we will have some gain on sales and expect it to be able to record close to \\xc2\\xa51 trillion level of the gain as long as we see the same level of the share price of Alibaba as of today. So, that's how you can understand this situation. So, every quarter basis, so this will come back every quarter for the coming two years, and I do believe that Alibaba is a great company, and so, that we are expecting and also hoping that the share price of Alibaba will go up. And the more the share price goes, then that we will see the more derivative loss in accounting explanations, and then later on that you will see the gain afterwards. So, we are actually liking \\xe2\\x80\\x93 making a deposit here. So, that's how you can see. In the borrowings, we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 people may think that we are excessive on debt and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but we actually, up to 3.5 times is actually the indicator for us over the net interest-bearing debt. Currently, it's 2.9 times. So that the EBITDA, which is close to the operating cash flow, up to 3.5 times, we believe this is a healthy level that something that we see as one of our KPI, and currently it's 2.9 times effectively. On the other hand, we do have a lot of public entities and we're are expecting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we would like to keep the debt less than 35% or so and that, too, we are currently 21%, so that we have enough room and we believe that we are in a healthy status on our debt as well. So, suppose that you have your own savings individually, you have \\xc2\\xa51 million savings, and for that \\xc2\\xa51 million loan, how much loan can you raise? How much loan do you think is the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or the asset is healthy enough? Shares, securities, and everything, the asset is \\xc2\\xa51 million, probably up to \\xc2\\xa5350,000, probably the loan can be healthy enough. That's how I feel. And debt, right now, for the company, we are 21%, so that we believe it is just about healthy level. That's the kind of KPI that we are looking at, the balance between the debt and the asset in that business operation, and we're trying to keep a good balance of those two. And in addition, we have issued hybrid bonds, U.S. dollar denominated hybrid bonds, and actually, 50% equity treatment from rating agencies and also are recorded as equity and that help us enhance our finance stabilities. Next is the Domestic Telco business. On this occasion, for the first time in a long time, the EBIT became negative 9%. This means that we still, in the Domestic Telco business, in the next five to 10 or 20 years, in terms of that, we will be able to still healthily grow that business. Therefore, in the most recent profits to be secured for or to be maximized put aside, we should have the customer base to be increased as much as possible. Therefore, advance investments, which is healthy, if there are such areas, we will act on them, which is our decision. And therefore, various sales promotional measures have been taken up. As of that, the result is that there is a 9% reduction in EBIT. On the other hand, the free cash flow against the previous year is up by 10%. So, in what areas in the next five, 10, or 20 years will we have the growth strategy to be taken up? Yahoo! Japan's synergistic effects will be enjoyed, IoT follows robotics, and also WeWork and other various businesses will be deployed in Japan. For that sake, be it corporate or individual customers, the customer base should be more expanded. Therefore, various sales promotional measures have been acted on. For example, this is [indiscernible] (21:06) set with the optical fiber. So, optical fiber comes to your home and mobile contract discounts can be enabled. This is presently very much steadily increasing and the customers may increase furthermore. In the initial two years, there may be discounts that are addressed specifically, so that portion leads to the fact that temporarily, the earnings may be reduced. The optical fiber service, unexpectedly, is steadily increasing. Therefore, I think this is a good point. So, growth should not be restrained. It should be more grown. In addition, Yahoo! Japan synergy should be also taken up. Yahoo! Shopping 10 times loyalty points every day or Yahoo! premium services as in SoftBank mobile customer to be given benefits are the promotional measures we're conducting. And this asset advanced investments can probably constrains the profitability, but next year and the year after that a healthy revenue increase will be achieved. So, the net addition for smartphones is up by 61%. Very steadily, this business is growing. As mentioned early on, SoftBank Hikari cumulative subs is more than 4 million against the previous year. It's around 2 times, up by 79%. Therefore, this is steadily growing, and the business model also has the profit achievable model. 10 years ago, Yahoo! BB was taken up, and the optical fiber services temporarily was tried on and on, but the profit did not come up by this model. But at this moment, the model achieves the profitability, therefore, a proactive customer expansion is being acted on. On the other hand, in the initial two years, there may be some smartphone side service to be discounted so that sales promotional fees will be advanced and these have to be paid for. After two years, the profit can be properly secured. Such a business model secures that the customers will be steadily increasing. And this optical household discount model has another effect, which is the reduction in churn. As SoftBank Mobile in the decade, there is a business ongoing. For the first time, the churn rate against our competitor, KDDI, churn rate is lower. For SoftBank, this is the first experience that we have being the winner, namely mobile, optical fiber and the home bundle discount has been reducing the churn rate. Therefore, the customers are very happy with our services. If both are available, it's better. Therefore, a steady churn rate reduction has been achieved. It is something to be very happy about. And Yahoo! Shopping also is increasing significantly. I think in Japan, e-commerce site, of which major sites, maybe, which is growing mostly. Increased rate, compared to Amazon and Rakuten, is more steadily increasing in our view. So, a steady growth is enjoyed. This is due to the Yahoo! Shopping, SoftBank Mobile, both having synergistic effects but at least to this increase. Therefore, as a sales promotional expense, this should be area we should proactively take up. So, we and also Yahoo! Japan site will have the 10 times of points to be 50% taken, and we are steadily increasing the customer base accordingly. Next, as I mentioned is the Vision Fund SoftBank Group impact. Vision Fund is where we at SoftBank have the GP role and SoftBank takes the responsibility for investment decisions. And SoftBank Group decides and by the investments made, the corporate value will be enhanced. In addition to that, for example, in Japan, there may be joint ventures with them with the areas we invest into and afterwards, there will be, for example, WeWork Japan and other various [ph] turnkey (26:40) Japan or other Japan corporates whereby similar to the time we have the Yahoo! Japan established, joint ventures with such corporations will be increasing. So, those businesses will be increasing going forward. We have to invest into various areas means that they're specifically in Asia or on a global deployment basis we'll be able to accelerate such activities. Furthermore, we will contribute to them and our Alibaba or Yahoo! Japan gained knowhow will be also shared with the other entities and that new business models will be what we learned from. So, we will mutually stimulate each other so that as a business model, more better cycle can be enhanced. The other day, SoftBank World was held. And that is where our major invested areas respective introductions were made in the world. The most advanced technology areas is where they are involved in. They continue to grow and it is an excellent situation be it net sales and also the amount of sales and the user compared to the previous month, 10%, 20% of increases are gained. So, they are continuously growing. At this moment even singularity is just about to face the dawn, so the Internet may have started just started such a exuberant excitement through singularity before dawn will experienced the same excitement is what I remember. That's why we should go into it. In order for that, the fund in order to go forward should be prepared. Internet started in many time years ago. We didn't have enough fund then. If at that time, we had the same amount of funds as now, then SoftBank now would have been something predominant, I'm sure. Internet industry of which most is becoming in SoftBank group may have been shown at that time. So, I think we have to be very proactive at that time. Presently singularity, artificial intelligence, AI, and IoT smart robotics is where SoftBank is proactively investing into. And that will go into the new share of economy and new technology platform will also be established. Therefore, we are about to launch into that product in order to prepare, Vision Fund has been inaugurated. And that as a preparation period is where SoftBank wanted to prepare for. That is what I am trying to say. WeWork Japan is one of such initiatives. WeWork Japan has a video, so please refer to it. [Video Presentation] (29:49-31:42) So, WeWork, we invest, and proactively become the majority shareholder of the WeWork business. Why does SoftBank start the real estate business or investing to such an industry? Many people will think that something is different or strange. So, we invested into DiDi, or Grab, or Ola, and rideshare company was also invested into. Why does SoftBank invest into a tax fee arrangement company? With that, maybe it's very remote from a technology business, many people still think so. That's about depending on each person's perspective, people see that in that way because they have old thoughts, and these are thoughts of the past. From our side, we consider that the world presently is predominantly changing, and IT progresses. Internet also evolves, smartphones evolve. The people in the world, their lifestyles are changing too. They're not owning, they're sharing with others. In order to share, the past Chinese-like bicycle rental services that rapidly have millions of units increasing is occurring, but that also means that bicycle rental business still exists from many, many years ago. What is the difference here? There is a predominant difference. The platform and non-platform namely in the street, in the towns is different from the normal rental businesses. And the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some people don't try to understand even if they explained. People who understand their perspective, they deem it a major business opportunity. We, in this new era that is up to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about to come up, we consider that now is the opportunity. Now, is where we need to be proactive. Up to now, our pillar of revenue, namely, the telecommunication business. If we are to stable on that and feel that cash flow can be earned and be able to be stable to go proactively because that time has come and space has come. And with our track record as a basis, our thoughts may be put on a bet, and friends around us who have the same thought has appeared. Therefore, the SoftBank Vision Fund has been established. Therefore, our domestic FY 2017 forecast would be that because we are very much stable, the EBIT may be reduced by some percentages. Even so, we should look towards the future. For that, we should prepare. So from our side, it's some kind of scope that we have at this moment. We don't have to stretch ourselves too much in order to create the financial results. Negative is okay. On a total basis, if we can secure our objectives, that is acceptable. So, on a temporary basis, we don't have to stretch too much in order to have some kind of profit on an accounting basis. That is our present SoftBank's position. Now, Sprint. We are now having more confidence in Sprint. And we have enough reason to do so because we stop \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hit the bottom on operating revenue and now it's turned around. Cost, continuously reducing, and we still have rooms to reduce. As a result, after they joined SoftBank Group, EBITDA doubled. Operating income tripled. Net income turned positive. And while reducing cost and turning around the sales, also reducing the CapEx, but actually, the quality of the network is the most advanced in terms of evolution of the network nationwide in the United States so that improvement in speed has been making a good momentum for the improvements amongst the peers. And we are more confident, and that's why we believe that Sprint can be standalone to compete in the market, but also, we can say that that will be the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 also the good opportunity to look into the industry consolidation more positively as well. If the business performance is not good, then also try to do some industry consolidation, you'll be in a very bad position because you're in a turnaround position and you have a good confidence in for the future, then you'll be in a good position and very positive in the discussion for the industry consolidation with better terms. That's why we are very happy to see such great results and I think sometime near future that we may come to some agreement as Marcelo mentioned in Sprint's earnings results announcement and I also feel the same way. Every day basis, I'm having a conference call with Marcelo and talking about this and I think we are very much confident in the business. And now that we are seeing more further signs on further growth. There is another SoftBank domestic business, which is Yahoo! Japan, which is steadily having that advertisement revenue increase. Shopping numbers in Japan, the largest election has been gained and the handling volume compared with the previous year is up by 40% in net transaction value. So, it is very actively growing the scale of company having the e-commerce and most growing is the Yahoo! Shopping business. Next is the company that I really aspire to when I was 17. I really yearned for a microprocessor business. And number one company of that is ARM and we have them with us and there is a 2% growth in revenue. On a shipment basis of the chips, there is an increase by 28%. The sales in a sense depends on how we handle it and it depends on how we handle it, namely, the market share in smartphone for example means that 99% and more have been achieved already. Therefore in a sense, the sales is where we can decide on at a certain price, in which case, the impact can be exercised to a certain extent, but we shouldn't be too greedy and we aren't taking it too greedily. But the number is 28% increase on the chips shipped. So, it's securely upcoming. So, this is the time to accelerate investment at that time. ARM doesn't have a factory. Therefore, the maximum investment is to the headcounts, to engineers and maximum investment is to the engineers. Advanced investment for that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for technical areas means that there is a 25% investment increase of the engineers against the previous year. So, I think can be clearly achievable. In addition to that, there is ARM's new core that has been announced. This is the dynamic performance, 50% increase and higher power efficiency by 2.5 times. So, a rapid functional evolution has been gained. So, we really look forward to this. Cortex-A75 and A55 are also launched. So, continuously, the new technology has been launched. In addition, new GPU Mali-G72 has also been launched. Energy efficiency, AI, performance acceleration and in various ways, rapid evolution and progression has been made. For example, for the image recognition is dog but the person is there. Previously, you didn't know who was there, but presently, you will see that a person is standing there. So, this is how the image is recognized. We have reached this level. Alibaba also uses ARM chips in order to create a smart speaker. In addition, there are various IoT products to various devices where ARM will continuously be embedded into our peer. As I mentioned, in the next 20 years, ARM chip will be more than 1 trillion on the IoT devices. IoT devices, trillion to be coming in is what we assume. Therefore, ARM will be continuously growing. We really are glad we acquired the company. I am sure of it. As I mentioned earlier, SoftBank Vision Fund as an organization, as our structural model, what I imagine though from the beginning, how we would like to be. And I've been saying that how can we create the synergy group. And the key for this synergy group is the SoftBank Vision Fund, and that gives us a good base for the further development. We don't want to be just a investor. We just don't want to be investment business for the money gain or anything. We want to do is the information revolution. To make this information revolution, you cannot do it by yourself only. You do need a lot of synergies, a lot of powers to be gathered together. So that many entrepreneurs needs to be gathered together and create a great synergy group and as a one collective group that we can actually launch the information revolution. So, it doesn't necessarily mean that we are happy to control the subsidiaries more than 51% of the ownership. That's not the relationship that we like to have with the investees. The previous computer architecture, you have a core main computer, main core, and below there that there is a dumb devices, dumb terminals. And organization-wide you have a headquarter at the top and underneath of them there are many subsidiaries belongs to it. That's not the way that we are looking for as an organization. We rather like to see the Web-type of the formula \\xe2\\x80\\x93 formations. So, it's not senior or junior, but we would like to be more flexible, independent each other, gather together to create the synergy as a synergy group. And we are now very happy to say that we are ready to create such a group with this Vision Fund, and NVIDIA is one of that. Just a 4.9% we own, we don't control the company, but we do share the vision. And NVIDIA, which share the vision with us, especially in AI, artificial intelligence area that we've been seeing a great revolutions and Jensen is the great partner to share such vision. DiDi, as I mentioned earlier, this is one of the great example for the share economy. And they have world's leading mobile transportation platform with a great numbers of drivers and users and expanding the shares dramatically. Also, in the taxi segment, they're taking already 99% of the market share in China. And also, even in the rideshare segment, they have taken 95% of the market share in China. In health ware (sic) [health care] segment, Guardant, it's a company detects cancers based on gene sequences from the drop of the blood. And they are also taking great market share and are still growing. OSIsoft, the data platform is going to key for the industrial IoT and they are taking over 90% of the market shares in electricity, pharmaceutical, oil and gas and metals and mining, so they are providing a data platform. They are also with us. Nauto, camera device with artificial intelligence, monitors driver, also monitors outside of the car, analyzing AI to help and support the autonomous driving and collect the data. It has already reduced the collision incidents by 37%, so that many insurance companies are willing to have a contract with this company. Plenty is a company that's utilizing artificial intelligence in that IoT to farm the organic vegetables. There is a standard called GAP for the organic farming vegetables. And under the GAP standard, they have a shortest time of the permissions, and that permission has been given last month. And we have very much high expectation on this company, too. Area affectivity is only 1%. The farming area and usage of the water can be reduced by 99%, but still organic and safe and tasty vegetable can be farmed with artificial intelligence and IoT. Improbable, this is also a big simulation, a large-scale simulation company. Brain, not the public road, but within the limited areas, they start the autonomous driving cars. If you try to do the autonomous driving car right now, then you need permissions or approval from the authorities. But if you do it in the shopping malls or within limited areas, you don't need approval by the regulatories. And also, you can reduce the HR costs right away, and also be safe as well. This is for the commercial floor cleaners. So, usually, the people who are driving such as cleaners, floor cleaners in the store, but now that one of our company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 group company Brain adapt \\xe2\\x80\\x93 put adaptors on top of these floor cleaners, and with AI, they analyze the images and provide a self-driving service. So, in the airport, shopping malls, warehouses, so inside of those areas and facilities that they are already providing the self-driving floor cleaning and try to get the good reduction of the cost. So, that is going to be the last page of my presentation. In SoftBank Group, we are not the traditional business organization. Usually, you have your own mark, logos on your subsidiaries, share such logo with your investees, put the same name of the company and you color them with your own brand, but we are different. Brand can be free. You can be independent. And rather we don't want to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 want them to put our SoftBank brand. They can be freely joined together and grow, then they can graduate from the Vision Fund or they can graduate from the group so that we want to be growing entrepreneurs group. And that we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so that we can create the information revolution together. And also, it's not the complete merger, complete buyout of the one company, Silicon Valley, for example, and put them into the one business model. That's not the case that we are trying to do. We want to do our own unique organization methodology and also not like traditional venture capitals. Actually, the size-wise we are much bigger than the total of the venture capitals in the world and with that, we would like to gather together our synergy groups. That's my ideas of our synergy groups. So, that's our unique way and Sprint also now showing such a sign of the future growth as well.\",\n",
       " '2017 Q2': \"My name is Son. Thank you very much for joining today. Yesterday, there are many media coverage due \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are not only in the United States, also in U.S., Germany, in many places, I believe that there are some media coverage there, and I believe you are already aware of what the contents are. But for me, Sprint which is a SoftBank Group company and also T-Mobile in United States discussion in relating to partnership has been discussed. But this time that we officially ceased this discussion which has decided on the night of Saturday between the concerned parties, and we came to the conclusion. In the past several months, I myself has been looking into it and also wonders about it. But as a result, the time that I consider that we should look ahead, I always remind myself, that's the kind of a way that I should approach. So as it does, whenever I get lost, I should see ahead, far ahead. And then you come to the answer or conclusion when you see far ahead. So Sprint in U.S., now that it's number four in the market which is not a strong position at this moment. So number four player Sprint and the number three player, T-Mobile. And getting them together, could be a same size of the customer base as the Verizon and AT&T and also a good advantage there. And that was the original thought that we have and also that was the original basic strategy for SoftBank Group to decide into the U.S. market. Unfortunately, at the first try, because of the regulatory approval was most likely not be able to receive, so that we have to cease the discussion, and this time, because of the change of the administration, and we may be able to get a positive sign from the regulatory agencies. So, we had a hope of such to enter into the discussion again. However, in the process of the discussion, the company asked the partnerships, the company would not need one that we could get the management control, even not the stand-alone control but we wish to have equal partner with the counterparty for the merged company. Then that could be one of the option that we could consider. However, the counterparty wanted to maintain the management control by itself. Otherwise, they couldn't accept the idea. On our side also, at the board meeting about 10 days ago, which was two weeks ago, we held the board of directors' meeting on Friday. And there, we had Jack Ma was also present. Mr. Yanai from UNIQLO Fast Retailing. Of course, we had Marcelo from Sprint. Rajeev also there. Simon from ARM was also there. Ron Fisher, Ken Miyauchi. All the director was participated, and we had a discussion. But our common understanding of the board was that the Sprint or United States will be and has been the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whether it has been or it will be an important base for the strategy of the SoftBank Group or is it only the investment asset. If this is important base for the strategy of SoftBank Group then we should not let management control go. We shouldn't be merged. But also giving up the management control in 5 years later, 10 years later probably that will be the main direction that we should be taking. That was a common understanding all of the board of directors. So, right after that I myself made a call to Tim, the CEO of Deutsche Telekom, and we discussed that this is not a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 small details of the terms but rather this is the big agenda which is the management control so that we should cease the discussion. That's what I said from myself to Tim about 10 days go. So, I conveyed the message by myself to him. But it was only over the phone because we have spent so many months and continue the discussion, so that they shouldn't be the best way to cease the discussion only via phone. So, that we should have a face-to-face meeting and we both agreed on that idea. So, that on Saturday in Tokyo we had the concerned party altogether. The head of the concerned party which was total eight member has been gathered together, to have a discussion and came to the conclusion that we should cease the discussion on this matter. And I was asked that how I feel just about before, and I could say in one word, I'm feeling good. So, after I finished with all the concerns and everything, I think I feel clear \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I see a clear view, so I feel very good and also see very clearly, and that was the comment that I had to the question that I have just before this meeting. So, we just came to the conclusion which is very important decision of ours to cease merger talks. However, as I mentioned earlier, U.S. which is the biggest market in the world. And there, now that we have built a good base of our business in U.S. and we shouldn't let that go. That's the conclusion we came. Meaning, communication infrastructure is the infrastructure for information revolution for SoftBank to develop our further business from SoftBank Group in any way, especially in the past one year or so ago, it's already one year we have spent that we have acquired ARM. And this company in the coming 20 years, we believe they will be shipping 1 trillion IoT chipset from ARM. That's our forecast internally right now. So 1 trillion IoT chip to be distribute to all over the world, and there in United States, we believe most of the numbers will be connected to the Internet from United States. The user of human beings between users is one of the communication which AT&T and Verizon taking a dominant market share and they are ahead of us a lot. So it's not easy to exceed their base. Of course, if we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 without any such big move like we have considered the merger with T-Mobile and Sprint, otherwise, it's really not easy to exceed Verizon and AT&T. But when it comes to IoT, we may be at far advanced position than the others because we have ARM. Originally speaking, when SoftBank Group decided to acquire Vodafone K.K. in Japan, at that moment, DOCOMO and the KDDI/AU was far ahead of us and we came \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and also that Japan is already the very matured mobile phone market and why SoftBank is entering into this market. That kind of question came to me a lot. Most of the people couldn't understand, I understand. However, I thought that we are now entering into the mobile Internet market. And also, when that era comes, then mobile phone will not be the voice communication anymore. It's not for the voice talk anymore, but it's going to be the device for Internet. So mobile device for Internet which SoftBank believes is essential from our information revolution, and that was almost very much before the announcement of the iPhone launch. But I have already met with Steve Jobs that moment and also they were already underway of the iPhone development, which was not announced or published outside of the company but there that we have arrangements between myself and Steve Jobs. But back then, even I said so many times that we acquired Vodafone K.K. because of the mobile Internet, but now you see smartphone everywhere in the world. So that rather than number of the voice call into mobile phone, more times has been used of the mobile phones for Internet connection. So, now that the people understands because you experience the situation. And same thing will happen. The same thing will happen in larger scale; for people to communicate with people or for people to connect to the web or Internet, a radio communication infrastructure is there. But more is for things communicate with other things, that's IoT. From that perspective, Sprint is in the U.S. aware the value is the highest and very important. And if we give up the control of Sprint in such important market, we would regret that in 5 years, 10 years. And even though in a short-term, Sprint share price or SoftBank's share price may drop but still I would feel good about this decision which is to cease merger talks. So, no matter how hard I try to explain about my feeling and probably 90% of people would say that that's just because I hate to lose but I still honestly feel good about this decision. And more importantly, Internet not only for mobile communication, but also for home communications and for automobile communication or connected cars, and very high speed and no matter where you are, whether in a mountainous area and where you drive and where you live, maybe you live in a mountainous area but still you can enjoy high speed broadband network. So, not only building our cell sites on the ground, but also building sites while providing communication from the sky, OneWeb just an example, like our optical fiber cable speed communication can be delivered by satellites, low orbit satellites. Traditional satellite communication is slow and the bandwidth is very narrow. Even though you get connected, still your speed is very low. But if your satellites are in low orbit and if the satellites are so many \\xe2\\x80\\x93 low orbit means 30 times closer to the Earth than high orbit satellites. And that means you can connect to the Earth just several tens of milliseconds communication. And speed will be 100 megabits per second to gigabit per second. That means it's equivalent to optical fiber like communications to be delivered by the satellite or by the space from the space. And beneficiaries will be users in the U.S. and IoT, quadro play can be provided to users over radio, Internet, and also the users can enjoy voice communications, as well as video services like a cable TV, and also fixed broadband. So, quadro play has been very popular in Europe and also in Japan, but in the U.S., it's still not popular yet. So, in the States, quadro play is beginning to start. And we have OneWeb which is a weapon that no other competitors would have. So, ARM's IoT and OneWeb would make Sprint different from just a traditional communication business to absolute differentiator. And with that differentiator, we can gain more customers. SoftBank Mobile was a dominant provider of the iPhone in the past. And with that weapon, we were able to gain customers more than others and more quickly than others. We don't have exclusivity of iPhone sales anymore, but ARM has dominant market position in terms of IoT chips and OneWeb have great spectrum bandwidth and you cannot simply buy those assets. But we already own those valuable assets in the group, and with such competition, get serious. I'm sure that looking back we would feel much better about this decision which is to keep Sprint in the group. While not only ARM and OneWeb, but also we have a SoftBank Vision Fund in the group that is very powerful tool. And $100 billion of Vision Fund can make us invest in unicorn companies. That's what SoftBank 2.0 is all about, not only building our capabilities from the bottom to the up, but as a leading shareholder from 20% to 40%, and we have those pack of entrepreneurs having 20% or 40% of the stakes. And by bringing them together, we would deliver the SoftBank Group's real capabilities to the market. And most of our assets in a portfolio would utilize the infrastructure, and U.S. is the biggest market that we would invest in. So communication infrastructure is critical for us to deliver information to those markets, including the U.S. So keeping control of Sprint allows us to build future strategy of the SoftBank Group. It's not a matter of small terms and conditions, like how much the asset would be. Fundamentally, already 10 days ago on our side, SoftBank side, we had already made a decision to cease the merger talks, and we conveyed a message to the other party face-to-face which took place the day before yesterday. So, suspension of merger talks might bring Sprint share price down and it was actually good for us because we would be able to buy more stakes of Sprint. And up to 85%, we can buy Sprint share without having the board of directors' approval. So as a first step, we will buy Sprint stake up to 85% without going through authorization process, and that was announcement we just made. So, I think that's pretty much all about what you wanted to hear today more than anything else. Now, let me walk you through the quarterly results of the SoftBank starting from the numbers. Net sales, adjusted EBITDA, EBIT, net income are shown on the slide. Let me highlight one by one. As you can see, the net sales, as you can see, and this is the adjusted EBITDA. In the breakdown of EBITDA here, yellow portion, is Sprint. As you can see, Sprint has been growing. EBIT 35% up, and what is the driver for EBIT, which is shown on the next page breakdown here. From the top, Vision Fund, \\xc2\\xa5186 billion contributing to the profit, especially because we have ownership of the NVIDIA and that valuation gain has been cumulating steadily, which can be a one-time gain but this is quite a good sign of the start of the Vision Fund, I believe. In the next, as you can see by color, yellow is actually growing the most. And this is the Sprint business. Before Sprint is the burden of the SoftBank Group, so that the people thought that Sprint has been a headache for the SoftBank Group and I believe many of you still believe that way. However, from our point of view as you can see these colors, EBIT which is the core business has been growing the most, and that is Sprint. The competitive domestic market which is quite matured actually Sprint is growing the most. So, \\xc2\\xa5100 billion has grown to \\xc2\\xa5200 billion of the EBIT therefore I believe you should refresh your mind for the view for Sprint. And net income, down by 87% which looks a big drop you may see, but when you come to more details breakdown and analysis. Last year, the white portion here is the gain on sale of Alibaba share and also sale of Supercell shares was also or this part. This is the last year one-time gain. So, we should take that out and also derivative for using Alibaba share. The loss from the derivative was about \\xc2\\xa5340 billion after the tax effect. So if the derivative, this is the onetime. But if without the derivative, then effective substantially the 42% of the increase that can be also interpreted that way as well. So, accounting, there are many ways of [ph] one goes (00:26:00) so that you may say that Masa is trying to make a good excuse here and there and that can be seen on Internet news and so on. But that's also one of the end goals that you can see. And this is just the one effect that I can deliver to you. So for myself, I believe substantially, this was the increase by 42% in net income. But the biggest impact from here was the derivative, I believe. Of course there was a gain on sales of Supercell, and so on, but the derivative portion is something that I would like to go in more detail. Here, we've been explaining about the derivatives on Alibaba but it's still also difficult to understand, I believe. So, so far, the cumulative, the Alibaba share, last year, we had a monetization partially. And that time, we had a prepaid forward contract. And that would be settled June 2019. So, that will be the time of the official sales. Up until then, it's like a variable prepaid forward contract. So, accounting-wise, this is recorded as a derivative. So, the share price at the time of June 2019, in the meantime, the share price goes up, then that's going to be recorded as a derivative liabilities here in negative numbers. However, exactly the same number will be recorded as a derivative gain at the time of settlement which is June 2019 in positive numbers. So, the red portion, when you see more increase in this red portion, which means the more you see the share price increase in Alibaba, then the more that you see the numbers here in the red box. And are you not happy seeing not increasing the share price in Alibaba? No. I'm so happy to see the share price increase in Alibaba although it's going to be recorded as a derivative liabilities. So, this negative figures exactly the same numbers which has been recorded as a derivative liabilities is going to be recorded as derivative gain. So, it's just a matter of timing. And because it's the prepaid for the contract, so that we have already seen the gain on sales. So, as of today's share price, you see evaluated gain and on top of that, you see the gain on sale. So in total, \\xc2\\xa51.2 trillion will be recorded at the time of settlement which is June 2019 as of today's share price. So, you see the share price increase in Alibaba then that you see more derivative liabilities again, so that the market may think that this is a sad things to see the increasing share price of Alibaba but actually that's not true. For me, it's not that way. So, about a year-and-a-half later, at June 2019, you see the same price, same amount, to be recorded. So, in one word, this is just a matter of timing, so not positive and negative at all. So, at the time of June 2019, we can be the biggest gain company in Japan. On top of that, of course, we will have a core business revenue and so on, but this is only limited for the Alibaba and this has been already forward-contracted. So, when it comes to the Alibaba share price, are we happy or not happy, regardless of Alibaba share price? No. It's not true. We are happy to see the increase in Alibaba share because Alibaba share price has been already doubled because the monetized portion of Alibaba has only the part of what we own. Actually, the remaining of the Alibaba ownership we have. How much are they? It's shown on this page. So, last year was \\xc2\\xa56.4 trillion of the value, but now it's \\xc2\\xa514.5 trillion which is \\xc2\\xa58 trillion increase just over 12 months. Originally, at the time of the Alibaba share investment, it was \\xc2\\xa52 billion. Only for the one year, it has increased by \\xc2\\xa58 trillion. Am I happy or not? Is it a matter of timing for the derivatives? It's just nothing matters at all for me. For derivatives, you can ignore 100%, but this is just a matter of timing. Rather, we should look at the value of Alibaba shares. When you double the Alibaba share price, then you have increased \\xc2\\xa58 trillion of value for the gains in SoftBank Group. So, from that sense, we're, of course, happy to see the increase in Alibaba share, 100% happy for that, 100% happy about the Alibaba share increase. So, once again, that I wanted to review this because many of you may not understand fully about this. So, we've been investing so many things so that people may feel the risk about it, and still I understand there are still people, how much debt that we have. So, in the Domestic Telco, against, EBITDA we have about 2.8 times of the debt. So, EBITDA is \\xc2\\xa51.2 trillion, and the operating cash flow is about \\xc2\\xa51.2 trillion. And for that, we have about 2.8 times, which is \\xc2\\xa5 3.3 trillion of net interest-bearing debt. So, 2.8 times is quite healthy levels for the domestic telecom. Verizon and AT&T, for example, should have this kind of debt ratio. And from other businesses perspective, equity value of holdings have about \\xc2\\xa520.1 trillion (sic) [\\xc2\\xa522.1 trillion] (00:33:09) against that. Our net interest-bearing debt is \\xc2\\xa54.7 trillion. So, we have 5 times more than the debt level excluding unlisted businesses or companies that we invested at. And retail investors, looking at debt, of their own and if they have five times more value of stock than their debt, they should feel good about that. And from investment company's perspective, we have five times more stakes than the debt level. And from telecom business perspective, we are very financially healthy company. And now looking at Domestic Telco business, EBIT down by 7% and we are trying to gain more customers, new customers which is doing well and we need to provide discount to new customers and discount to gain more customers should have positive impact if we don't have many new customers. But since we are steadily growing customer base, we are seeing EBIT down. But when it comes to free cash flow, we have about \\xc2\\xa5334 billion and we are practically investing in such areas like home bundle discount. I mentioned earlier quadro play and providing four services not only mobile telecom but also broadband. SoftBank initially started from ADSL business and optical fiber and Air service is what we are providing to customers. So, we accounted customer acquisition expenses to offer a home bundle discount and also Yahoo! Shopping 10 times loyalty points every day for SoftBank mobile users. So, every day they can get 10 times more loyalty points than the usual Yahoo! Shopping shoppers by making a purchase over the Yahoo! Shopping portal. And those are the proactive investment. And when we get new customers we offer discount, but as we build customer base and the revenue from the customers should have surpassed at some point than the expense that we paid to gain new customers. And that surpassing point should come next year. Even though we suffer loss in revenue this year, but next year, we expect \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not official commitment, but we expect internally that we should see a gain in revenue and profit next year from domestic telecom business. We are confident about that. Again, not official commitment and if we don't reach the target, blame Miyauchi. And if we succeed, praise me. And internally I'm joking about this and Miyauchi-san is very careful. And so long as Miyauchi-san is saying we can do it and we should be able to do it, make it happen. And net additions in smartphone, again we steadily increased smartphone users in SoftBank network. It includes both our Yahoo! mobile and SoftBank. And combined together, we expect to be positive in terms of revenue and profit next year. And why we are confident about that? Because one reason is, steady growth of fiber-to-the-home service users. In fact it grew sharply in the last two years to 4.36 million homes or users. And by getting these customers short period of time, we would suffer some loss because of acquisition cost. But, we are seeing the customer satisfaction growing. And Yahoo! Shopping like I said earlier, we offer 10 times more loyalty point to gain customers. So with this campaign, in the last eight months, we saw three times more buyers that make shopping through SoftBank mobile. So Yahoo! and SoftBank share the acquisition costs which goes well in terms of growth addition. And also from domestic business perspective, we built a joint venture with Mizuho Bank and it took a great start. In fact, in the morning, I had a meeting with Mr. Sato, CEO of Mizuho Bank, and he was happy about this result. And he said that we made a good start because our borrowers are very good borrowers. And when it comes to expansion of new areas, we are going to build joint venture in Japan with the companies that we have invested in through SoftBank Vision Fund. And what is SoftBank's core business? Is it telecommunications? I have never thought that SoftBank's core business is telecommunications in any one day in my whole life, because SoftBank's core business is information revolution, and the telecommunication is a core business critical to SoftBank Group, but fundamentally, we have a pack strategy. And by leveraging a pack of entrepreneurs, we would deliver information revolution, and parts of that pack strategy are those companies that we have invested in and we built our joint venture with in Japan. And in the next few years, we would invest about \\xc2\\xa510 trillion, and that will be the volume combining all global venture capitals put together. And we as one company invest about \\xc2\\xa510 trillion in those unicorn companies, and most of unicorn companies in the world are the ones that we have invested in. And we will start in U.S. and India and Southeast Asia and Middle East. In any market, any area, any regions, our group companies will be there and immerse in those markets as a part of our pack strategy. And not only to the communications, but also peripheral areas are the ones we would see fruits will be beared and that will be blossomed. Now, Sprint. As I mentioned in the beginning of my presentation but I also give you an update on our latest results. So net operating revenue you can see. So now that we are hitting the bottom and turning around cost reduction, making a smooth reduction. As a result, after the Sprint joined SoftBank Group, the EBITDA has been doubled. Operating income, as I mentioned earlier, almost \\xc2\\xa52 billion, coming close to \\xc2\\xa52 billion, only in the six months, first half. This is a big deal, I believe. Just about a few years ago, they are making loss. And now it's making income steadily increasing. So this is a rapid growth. So in the six months and this much of the operating income is a big evolution, big deal. So that's something that I want you to understand. But you may say that you may have a lot of payments of the interest. However, even after the payments of the interest, still we're making a positive now that we are coming to this era. And what's the base for that? It's the network or the infrastructure improvements are the base for this improvement now that we are catching up largely with the competitors. And on top of that, we've been providing the many know-hows from SoftBank to Sprint and further network investments so that we would like to catch up with peers and also exceed the peers. So that in many of the items that we are now to be ready to exceed the peers. So three to four years, I understand this is not an easy game. Cost reduction always very tough. Reducing the cost but at the same time to increase the customer base, which is not easy at all. We've been struggling and we have to play a very tough game. But at the same time, we are making a steady increase in EBIT like you saw in operating income, increase by 80%, and net income is now turning into positive. Another core business of SoftBank Group is Yahoo! Japan. Advertising revenue is quite flat in search ads but the display ads is increasing steadily especially shopping and e-commerce. E-commerce as a business model, now becoming the essential business model for our society. Amazon is still making a loss in e-commerce. They are making money in cloud business but still their market cap became such a huge size. So not making money in the recent years but rather to go for the customer base acquisition. And this platform becomes essential for the every society. That business model has been already proved so that now we are [ph] heading (00:45:54) strategies towards getting more customer base and market share. So not only Amazon, but Alibaba for example, not only the e-commerce, they are already making a good net income, at the same time increasing in the cloud business. So, Yahoo! Shopping is also the same that they are increasing the number of shopping item to 290 million which is the biggest selection in Japan right now. As a result, shopping transaction value has increased by 39%. So total e-commerce in Japan is 11% increase. So total e-commerce in Japan is 11% increase and of which we are taking 39% increase here. So that amongst the Japanese e-commerce, the size wise, we are the largest in terms of growth here. So, that even in e-commerce, we are making a steady but rapidly growth here in Japanese market. And now, ARM, which is a big purchase. Am I happy about this purchase? Yes, I am. I'm so happy to have this company in our group. And I am becoming even more confident in the past 12 months. So, the 20% increase in revenue in the products, AI chipsets in development, chip for server and collaboration with NVIDIA. In NVIDIA, we have invested via Vision Fund, and we are making good profit from there. But in a technology aspect, we are making a lot of alliance with this company. So, ARM in IoT era. In smartphone, they have already taken 99% of the market share. In IoT, they have already have a big \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the biggest market shares in IoT products but that's also increasing. So, ARM, I'm so happy to have them in the group, so that now we are aiming towards the 1 trillion chipped devices in the future. Alibaba, as I mentioned in the past, only one year from \\xc2\\xa56 trillion to \\xc2\\xa514 trillion of their ownership value. So, \\xc2\\xa58 trillion increase in unrealized gain there. And this Alibaba, how are they doing? You see total revenue, it's still growing, only in three months already increasing by 61% from \\xc2\\xa5570 billion to \\xc2\\xa5917 billion. For your reference, the Amazon's revenue count and the Alibaba revenue count is not the same. Amazon, all their revenue are the one that are sold from the Amazon platform. But Alibaba is not counting what they have sold in their platform. They have only counting those commissions from the advertisement and so on. So, the transaction volume is actually much bigger than Amazon, and every e-commerce or total \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or is equivalent or even bigger in Alibaba. So, it's overwhelming, number one. And this Alibaba in net total revenue in one year for 61% increase and also 83% in income from operation. Net income-wise, 71% increase. So, 71% here, but the three months net income is \\xc2\\xa5367 billion. So, annualized basis, it's about \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion of the pace that they are making net income. Annualized, \\xc2\\xa51.5 trillion net income already, and that is increasing by 71% by year. So, it's a tremendous cash machine now. It's not a bubble when you see the share price of Alibaba. It's not a bubble that our ownership is becoming the \\xc2\\xa514 trillion. It's the absolutely net income number is actually proving that it's not bubble. So, free cash flow, how about that, and when you see the free cash flow, you can see the same level of the amount has been generating after tax, after CapEx. So, Alibaba in true sense, they are making absolute numbers of revenues and income and cash flow, so that their share price is increasing. It's not a bubble. And now, SoftBank Vision Fund, what we have invested, not only the existing portfolio but also that we are investing future investment. People say that Alibaba was lucky for you. So excluding Alibaba for the past 18 years, actually 44% of investment IRR. So 44% value is increasing in portfolio. With this size, when it comes to \\xc2\\xa520 trillion level with 44% you never be able to find in anywhere in the world. And we've been repeating that for 18 years so far. But not only that, we are structurally finding and discovering the companies which it could be equivalent to Alibaba and trying to invest in those companies. So that structure is now here in SoftBank Vision Fund. So in the six months in the past, we have already invested about 20 companies which is quite a large size in each 20 companies, in average \\xc2\\xa5100 billion or so in average. As you may know, venture capital's fund total size is about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion size. Just one fund is about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion size. Our case, one project is about \\xc2\\xa5100 billion size. So there are some small investments as well but that's the size that you can imagine. So with this size, with this large investment, I don't believe that there are such a sizable or equivalent fund in the world. So this is the very first new type of the fund and new type of company is SoftBank Vision Fund. So in the six months, we have invested in this level. One example is Slack. I don't know or who knows Slack? Maybe 5% of you know Slack, but 95% of people might not know Slack. But Slack has been growing so rapidly, mainly in the United States. In terms of revenue and sales, LinkedIn and the Salesforce and other companies have been listed. But in fact in terms of sales revenue, Slack is, I believe, is the fastest-growing enterprise in the world. And we have invested in Slack. Also, Mapbox which is competitor of Google in terms of mapping technology. And things like Twitter and United Nations, most enterprises started using Mapbox technology. Flipkart, India's number one retailer or e-commerce. They have 60% of e-commerce market share in India, which is number one, and bigger than Amazon India. It's bigger than Amazon in terms of market share in India, and it's very difficult to see someone who is bigger than Amazon in the market. In China, we beat Amazon. Alibaba is now absolutely number one. And I believe that next to China should be India in terms of the size. And in such a huge potential market like India, Flipkart has 60% market share which is a good start. Paytm, in China, Alipay has been successful as a business model. And Alipay and SoftBank support Paytm. And again, next to Alibaba Group, we are the second largest shareholders of Paytm. Again, it's a part of pack strategy. Fanatics e-commerce specialize in sports apparel. And like football in the States, the Major League and basketball, the golf, and Fanatics exclusively can sell goods to those fans. This is growing so fast in the U.S. It's difficult to beat Amazon in traditional e-commerce business but when it comes to very specialized category like this, this is very interesting. Roivant, very young founder, like a 30-years-old or something and in last three years, he listed three companies or so and again, young founder built this business and with AI, gathering data to help creating a medicine is something this is all about and infectious disease like influenza and stuff like that. By using AI, they help developing vaccine and medicine to help curing infectious diseases. Again, we have invested in this Roivant Sciences. Vir Biotechnology and ZhongAn Insurance, a leading online-only insurtech company in China and that they have over 500 million users and policies sold that were 8.2 billion and they started from scratch four, five years ago and it grew so rapidly. And last month, this insurance company got listed in Hong Kong shareholder and we were anchor investor when they went public and we want to develop global market with this insurance company. So U.S., China, in IoT, robot, e-commerce, in different markets, different areas, different spaces, we have a specific fund manager. We have experts to deliver strategic synergies. And the size of bubble you can measure to see how much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in fact, the size of the bubble is just the indicator. It's not a specific size of the investment. But you can have an idea where we invest more than others, in terms of regions and categories. Again, we believe that we have made a good start. We will accelerate information revolution and SoftBank's main business is information revolution. Information revolution is SoftBank's main business, not the traditional investment company, not in a traditional telecommunication company. Our main business is to realize information revolution and during that with pack of entrepreneurs and we have a pack strategy. In fact, two weeks ago, I visited Saudi Arabia and met Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. And the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia will create a new city by investing about \\xc2\\xa550 trillion (sic) [\\xc2\\xa557 trillion] (00:59:41) and the new city should be the most advanced city in the world. In fact, much more advanced than Dubai. That kind of image you can have. And we will be actively involved in this initiative by helping Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. And sitting next to him, we made announcement of this new venture. And we want to be serious about that. A part of that effort is in energy area and Saudi Power Corporation, we signed MOU with PIF. So that SoftBank would invest in Saudi power company, and how much percentage and how much actually we'll invest, we will figure out in the next three \\xe2\\x80\\x93 few months. But as a direction, while Saudi power company used oil to generate power \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and gas as a power, so, they use oil and gas to generate electricity, which is waste. But going forward, oil should be traded at market price, and the subsidy to electricity should be abolished. That's a direction that other country came up with. And how can they do that? And Saudi Arabia has a great sunshine in the world, and they have sand, they have huge land. By utilizing their resources like sunshine and sand and land, they should be able to build the world's biggest electricity power plant in the world. After March 11 disaster in Japan, SoftBank has been actively involved in energy area and SoftBank has been working on about 30 cases. And also we entered India market in terms of solar power energy, and we already deployed solar energy in India. So by leveraging our experiences in Japan and India, we want to go bigger in Saudi Arabia. And also we want to generate facilities and we want to provide solar energies by having facilities in Saudi Arabia. And we want to build the world's biggest infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. And for that, not a small operation of solar power generation but we would like to be involved in management by being a big shareholder of the power generations. And we would like to make the companies switch or use the higher ratio of the solar power generation, renewable energy generation. Also, storage for the power that we would like to build the large size which is most advanced in the world. That's the kind of way that we are building our business plan at this moment. And we do believe that this is going to be very much profitable business as well. This is, again, is going to be one extension of the Vision Fund investment activity. So, one of the portfolio for the Vision Fund going forward. The Vision Fund is not only invest in small start-up or small company but it's also invest in DiDi, [indiscernible] (01:04:23) and so on. But also at the same time, other companies which I mentioned [ph] last year (01:04:31) and also some shares to be invested in kind for ARM. And at the same time, the business like this that the Vision Fund will be investing in to expand the ideas of the business. So, SoftBank is not only the one position the company, actually with the pack strategy, we would like to have information revolutions and further revolutions, IoT, AI, to be thoroughly used, so that we are the most biggest user of IoT and AI. On top of that, we would like to include the renewable energy. So we at SoftBank Group would like to go towards further growth. So we are not staying in one place. As I mentioned in the beginning, that's the reason why that we have decided to maintain our management control in Sprint without considering the near term of the share price fluctuations but we see this Sprint business as a very important strategic base for the 5 to 10 years long term. So that's all my presentation. Thank you very much. \",\n",
       " '2017 Q3': \"My name is Masayoshi Son from SoftBank. Thank you very much for your time today. Recently, I've been thinking that, what is human being? What is life? What is company? What is enterprise? Because artificial intelligence has been evolved so much with great speed, so that's the kind of a basic question comes up to me in my mind and I've been thinking very deeply about those kinds of questions these days. [ph] From the sense (00:02:27) I'd again thought about what is SoftBank and also I thought that how the SoftBank should be, not in the short-term period, but also mid to long-term period like how should we set the company. That's something that I've been thinking these days. So with this today's presentation, not only show you the recent result of the business, but also, I would like to discuss and present to you the view on how I see SoftBank and how the SoftBank, the enterprise should be. That's something that I would like to touch on today with this opportunity. So now, let me go into the presentation. So what is SoftBank? About this question, I would like to come back on this question after I go through the business results and the overview of the business performance. So always keep in mind that what is SoftBank and then that I would like to explain to you the business results and performance. So consolidated results, as you can see, net sales adjusted EBITDA, EBIT, net income. As you can see, these are the figures and the results for each. And the breakdown for that that I would like to explain a little bit detail. First, net sales, up 4%. And as you can see by colors here for the breakdown of these net sales. Adjusted EBITDA, up 3%. Also, you can see the breakdown by colors, especially, that big growth came from Sprint, as you can tell from the chart. EBIT 24% up, so we see the 24% up in the breakdown. As we can see from this slide, Sprint made a big contribution, almost doubled, in EBIT so that you may think that the Sprint is troubled company, but actually, they are making a steady turnaround in the nine months period in EBIT, \\xc2\\xa5290 billion result has been made. So compared to the year-on-year basis, it has been doubled. So that's very important point here. And also on the very top, which is the Vision Fund, SoftBank Vision Fund. It's just about a year since the launch of the SoftBank Vision Fund, but has already made about \\xc2\\xa5236 billion level of the contribution to the EBIT. Net income, 20% increase. In here, we have some impact from changes to Sprint's deferred tax on the provisions of new U.S. tax law. A year before, we had a one-time gain due to the sales of Supercell shares and Alibaba shares. So that was another one-time effect. So both of them are one-time, but even without such a one-time effect, actual growth in net income is still 39%. In here, derivative loss from Alibaba is also included. And the derivative loss, if once the Alibaba share price increase, then accounting-wise that's the way we recognize derivative loss which was explained in a previous announcement, but we still have some misunderstanding from the market. Always that many questions comes up with this, so let me once again remind you what is this about. So end of December, based on the share price by the end of December and in the cumulative basis, we have about \\xc2\\xa5662 billion of derivative liabilities. But this is the accounting number. So next year, June the amount will be reversed as the derivative gain. So once we have a [ph] recall or the (00:07:37) derivative liabilities, it is not the sad news or a bad news, but this is just a time difference. So the same amount of liabilities will be recognized in gain. So that's something that I want you to understand so that the derivative loss for the liabilities is substantially zero. On top of that, we have gain on sales of \\xc2\\xa5565 billion so that in June 2019, we are expecting that this much of the gain on sales from Alibaba share. And on top of that, because we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 recognizing derivatives liabilities due to the Alibaba share increase, but with this transaction, we have monetized the Alibaba share. But actually, the remaining, which is not a monetized portion of Alibaba share is larger and this portion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually, the more our share price increase, the more that we will have the unrealized gain of Alibaba share. Therefore, in terms of Alibaba shares, it's better for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of course, for us and SoftBank shareholders if we see our share price increase in Alibaba so that you see the derivative liabilities due to the Alibaba share price increase, but this is only the one-time time difference from the accounting point of view, so that this is not a real loss. That's something that I wanted to remind you once again so that we can have a better understanding. So excluding such one-time gain and loss and substantial net income was increased by 39%. And since many people thinks or believes that the SoftBank is on so much debt and once that interest rate increase in United States and we have a lots [indiscernible] (00:09:50) or because of the pressure they take in market if that kind of thing happens, because of too much [ph] faith (00:09:55) in SoftBank, are we okay? That kind of question also comes in often, but year 2000, when we have our Internet bubble, we have gone through that we survived the bubble. That time, SoftBank was also cautioned that we may be bankrupt or we may not be able to survive. So that we have never imagined why we shouldn't believe that there will be no such equity market questions again because we do know and understand that we should be factor in such a crash, market crash happens time to time. So that's why for the balance of the debt, we always be very careful and we always seeing very close the balance of the debt. And how we do that? In the [indiscernible] (00:10:59), the cash flow from operating perspective up to 3.5 times against EBITDA, from our perspective healthy. In other words, we want to keep it under 3.5 times. When we acquired Vodafone Japan, it was 6.5 times. So we bought a lot when we acquired Vodafone K.K. But up to 3.5 times level, we think it's healthy, and at the moment, we have 2.8 times, which means that we are still in the range of safety. And regards to holding equity, with the assets that we have, up to 35% against assets we have, that's the threshold. Even though the share price goes down by half, we are still okay. So, up to 35% against the asset is the level which we should be okay. At the moment, it's not 35%, but we have 22%. So definitely we are still in system. Even though the stock market goes down, the value of the stock down by 50% or even one quarter, we are still okay, because net interest bearing debt divided by equity value of holdings at 22% which is again within the range of safety from our perspective. Again, we have gone through the Internet bubble, that's why we are really carefully managing our financial status. That's how we manage with the discipline. So talking about Sprint, our revenue flat, however, cost reduction efforts are going steadily well. As a result, since we acquired Sprint, adjusted EBITDA doubled in five years and operating income accordingly up by 92% year-on-year or $2.5 billion. And talking about tax reform, well, thanks to tax reform, Sprint has gained some benefits. So as a one-time effect, we have seen some positive impact on our results. But even excluding the one-time benefit, we were losing money in the past. But now we are gaining money. In fact, free cash flow doubled year-on-year. So from [ph] varieties of [indiscernible] (00:14:19) Sprint has been improving. And average download speed increased by 60%. So network-wise, it should be helpful for Sprint to acquire more customers. But Sprint or we are not satisfied with the current level of network. We want to build a next-generation network strategy. For example, we will build new macro sites. And also, we going to have a tri-band on cell site. And 2.5 gig [ph] GGP (00:15:01), we will leverage that spectrum even further. And we have strategic agreements with cable company or we will have strategic agreements with the cable company. And when you talk about 5G, Sprint would be the one that would leverage 5G more aggressive than others. Whether 2.5G is applicable to 5G or not, that has been a question in the industry. 2.5 gig band, Sprint has that band more than anybody else. In Japan, in fact, we utilize a 2.5G band for iPhone and others and, in fact, that band carries most the traffic in SoftBank network. And in the States, for 5G, we want to employ 2.5G as a standard for 5G, because that band has adopted a standard band by 3GPP. So that means that Sprint can leverage that band more aggressively going forward. In fact, early in 2019 we're going to start building network by leveraging 5G or 2.5G band. So with 5G network, Sprint has about 120 2.5G. But if you use a 60 meg, you can deliver speed like 1 gig. And if you use 100 megahertz of the 2.5G band, you can deliver 1.7 gig band, which means on the wireless network, we can deliver that speed, which means we can build most advanced, strongest 5G network. But also, not only 2.5G, other carriers in the world want to utilize [ph] medium range (00:17:46) band, but if you use a little bit wide band, it's like a hotspot coverage. That means it's not really useful as a mobile network, because [ph] medium range (00:18:00) network is more suitable for hotspot as opposed to broad coverage. But if you use 2.5G, you can build a network or coverage like 4G or even better than 4G or LTE. Then Qualcomm gives full support from chipset perspective and as a network vendor, Samsung, Nokia and Ericsson supports Sprint. So faster than anybody else and [indiscernible] (00:18:33) anybody else, Sprint can build a network, 5G network. That's how we see Sprint network. Other carriers don't have that much spectrum in the first place. And most of the bands that they have are used for 3G and 4G, but the Sprint, even though Sprint doesn't have as many users as others, but Sprint has most spectrum especially 2.5 gig band, they've got a great capacity in 2.5 gig band for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with 5G coming in, Sprint can build the strongest 5G network with a 2.5 gig. So Sprint will come back in terms of network when 5G is around. And to strengthen the management we have now Michel, former CEO of Altice and former CEO of Vodafone Europe, as a CFO of Sprint. So Sprint has bottomed out and now ready to turn around by major network number one in the States and by getting more customers. And when it comes to Sprint, whether they go on their own or collaborate or merge with others, we will continue studying a lot of options and opportunities going forward. And now I'll talk about Yahoo! Japan. Advertising revenue grew steadily. The Yahoo! Shopping is also growing well and shopping transaction value, in Japanese e-commerce. I believe Yahoo! is the most growing, fastest-growing e-commerce business in Japan and Mr. Kawabe will be our next CEO to lead Yahoo! Japan. And Yahoo! Japan is really a pensive mood, so to speak. And Arm, Arm-based chips shipped, \\xc2\\xa515 billion in nine months or \\xc2\\xa520 billion for one year. That has biggest share in mobile, because we already [indiscernible] (00:21:20) design of the chip so that we are expecting to accelerate the revenue increase going forward. And about this new chip, we have agreed with Samsung [ph] partner (00:21:35) chip and also in [indiscernible] (00:21:42) we're well-advanced, and also good pricing, new version chip design is now ready and licensing is now ready to start. On the server side, HPC, high-performance computing area is also aware that the Arm is developing. Also used in Nintendo Switch, IoT, and other products. Also, have more penetration in the Arm-based chip, and that we believe that we got the corner of the games, so that we have a stronger position in terms of the competition, so that they'll be able to expand the market share further. Alibaba, total revenue, 56% increase, of course, making a lot of upfront investment, but still they are making good net income, increased by 20%, free cash flow also increased by 35%, so that keeps growing. Fortress. So we have a technology area and the finance area and this company or this business is to enhance the final size of the resources and expertise, so that we have announced the transaction with Fortress and we have officially received the approval from the regulatory and we have completed the transaction, so that we believe it will be able to enhance the management and more expertise, leaderships, and so on. In SoftBank 2.0, I mentioned before and the key for that 2.0 is Vision Fund, with the SoftBank Vision Fund. Since the last earnings results announcement, we have already making a [ph] \\xc2\\xa520 billion (00:24:00) investment. And in the past three months, we have added 6 so that, in total, 26 companies are now a portfolio or the investee of SoftBank Vision Fund so that you can call it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it became the SoftBank family. And most of them are unicorn. They are already being unicorn or they are to be unicorn sometime soon. So those are the selected companies that we have invested from Vision Fund. So I would like to also share some of the new investments that we have made [ph] newly (00:24:40). For example, Compass, this is the real estate big data platform. So when you buy or sell the house, there are about 3% of the commission to the agents in Japan and same as U.S., about 6% of the commission charge needs to be paid to agent and that this company make it more efficient and create the platform to promote the transaction between buyers and sellers and they are making a great growth. This company, I believe, is going to be a great unicorn. And because one of the biggest shopping that the people does is the house or the home and I believe that this company can help that decision. And the other thing is the automobile. This is the number one used car wholesaler in Europe. And this is also the platformer and the company called Auto1. What's interesting about used car is that unlike new car, each used car is a unique product, so each individual car has its own price. So depending on the mileage, depending on the damage, depending on the condition of the car, the price is all different by car. So that the pricing is different and also this provides the option to the professional dealers. So this is very suitable for Internet service. In Europe, in the past four years, actually they started from very much scratch and with these four years, they have already grown. The cars sold by 420,000 and also the number of dealers have now achieving 48,000. So number of dealers increasing dramatically and they became number one as a platform in Europe. Katerra, this company provides the end-to-end design and architecture technology platform, IoT or AI for the designing of the new housing so that the Internet power has been fully utilized for this service. So that the design to sourcing to manufacturing and delivery to assembly. So as a result, project timeline used to be spending about two to three years, but now that they can provide the completion within \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about the year or so, so that the cost itself can be also reduced dramatically, because something that made it happen by this company. This company just launched about a few years ago, but they're also making a dramatical growth. And Wag!, U.S., they have most number of household with pets. Actually, number of pets is bigger than the number of kids. That's what I heard. In the dog walking, pet walking, so that this is the matchmaker between the dog owners and dog walkers. So this is the matching platform. As a result, in the past two years, again, starting from the scratch, active users in monthly basis achieving [ph] proud (00:28:34) 58,000 and also monthly active dog walkers exceeding 20,000. So it's like our Uber drivers and the Uber riders. So as a platform that the Uber is providing, but this is the dog version of Uber, so that's what \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that's probably easy to understand in a way. So it's also making a dramatical growth. The founder of this company is very young, but he has been developing a lot of social games and made it successful. And [indiscernible] (00:29:20) the social games, you have instructions between the players and players and you can increase [ph] print (00:29:28). So that kind of design and development has been again applied to this area, this industry, and that he made a very successful service here. We see lot of users. Ping An Good Doctor, this is the China's largest one-stop healthcare portal with the market cap and this Ping An subsidiary, which is the Ping An Good Doctor. So this company is also great. They have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 usually, when you have online service and you may be able to receive the advice from the medical doctors. But most of the cases, doctors who are actually seeing patients in hospital use his or her saved time to provide online service at the same time. But for this Ping An Good Doctor's case, they have around the clock dedicated Ping An Good Doctor for this service. So this is not the other jobs from the doctors, but, actually, these doctors are dedicated to Ping An Good Doctor service around the clock. So there are about thousand such doctors in the service. And it's growing dramatically. In fact, 190 million users are already registered to the service. So, again, this is growing so fast. So, dedicated doctors provide service online and prescription can be issued online, which is authorized by the Chinese government. And also, medical products can be sold online and also delivery of the medicines can be done. So, now, this is in the Vision Fund portfolio. And HealthKonnect, when you go to a hospital, you get some return if you have health insurance. And it's sometimes cumbersome to file for return of the charge that you pay, because you have to write on a paper and that's very inefficient. And there are varieties of insurance companies that provide such service. And from [ph] hospital's (32:05) perspective, it's cumbersome. It takes time and effort to process that claims. But when it comes to Ping An HealthKonnect, this HealthKonnect provides platform to hospitals, not only insurance that Ping An provide, but also other insurance claims are processed on the platform. And, again, this service is growing so fast, and I see huge potential in this platform. And again, this is now as a part of SoftBank Vision Fund portfolio. So, in different areas, unicorn companies or potential unicorn companies are joining in Vision Fund family, if you will. And Uber, which is often talked about in the media, and Uber is now one of our investees. And monthly riders 75 million per month, monthly drivers 3 million, and daily rides 15 million. So, Uber is the world leader in ride-sharing service. Now, Uber is part of our family. We are the largest shareholder with 15% of Uber's equity and we decided to send two board members, and the total investment approximately $7.7 billion for one investee. So, $8 billion for one investee, which is probably impossible for traditional venture capital to make, because venture capitals' fund total size is usually around $1 billion. That's the total size of the fund usually. So if the total is $100 billion or $50 billion, [ph] $7 billion (00:34:34) for a deal is impossible from traditional sense. So venture capital usually invests in different rounds, like A rounds and B rounds. But SoftBank Vision Fund or SoftBank, we invest in unicorn companies that is the leader of a certain segment, so whether or not they can do IPO, but when they can do IPO, that's the measurement that we are looking at when we make a decision on where to invest. And also something unique about us is, we have a global view. For example, in the case of ride-sharing, Uber, Didi, Ola and Grab, if you combine them together, daily rides is about 45 million per day. So, again, 45 million rides per day, if you combine Uber, Ola, Grab, Didi together. So that's the service side that we deliver. So the market share globally, you can calculate yourself, but anyway, for those ride-sharing services, SoftBank is the leading shareholder. So next-generation transportation, well, from global perspective, not only looking at Japan, but also looking at around the world, train services and subway services are something that you don't see outside city centers. So we can say that we have the biggest transportation network in the world, because in the future cars might end up being in commodity. So automobile maybe, from transportation perspective, can be just a part of the whole, so why the platform may have better value or bigger value than automobile itself. In fact, PC was the center of IT in the past, but hardware PC is now commodity, just a part of the IT. But platformer like Google, Alibaba, Amazon and Facebook, those platformers have better, bigger value than just PC makers. And in the case of transportation, we will be a big platformer on transportation, and automobile or hardware is just a piece of the puzzle or part of the whole picture. So, SoftBank through Vision Fund will continue investing in different areas to enhance the group's capability. In fact, there is certain limitation in industry, which is 30-year cycle. That's a common issue that IT companies may face. When you become the absolute number one in the world or you may think that the company will dominate the IT world, but whether that company remains at the top of IT world is a question, because the former IT leaders may not be the leaders anymore. Why? The peak of the growth comes and after the peak, they may not go bankrupt, but they will lose the glory days, because after 30 years, let's say you found a company at the age of 30 years old and in 30 years, you will be 60 years old and the breakthrough technology that you employed in the past may not be cutting-edge technology anymore in 30 years, obsolete. So you will lose the glory days after 30 years. But SoftBank Group, is it okay from SoftBank Group's perspective? Is there any solution which I have been thinking about? I myself don't want to be a bottleneck of SoftBank's growth, SoftBank's technology or SoftBank's service or SoftBank product, cannot see the limitation of growth. So what's the solution? From my perspective, solution is to form a SoftBank Synergy Group so that we can sustain for 300 years. I want to build an organization model that keeps growing for 300 years. That's a solution from our perspective. There have been lot of companies built in the world and the organization that may last for 300 years is unique. And maybe I can say that I invented an organization that create over 300 years of growth. And before I talked about that, let me show you some video clip. This is about 20 years ago. In a very small room I made this presentation, and this is the video clip. So speaking of SB Synergy Group, I want to build a web-based organization, especially the Internet industry dynamic, varied and borderless. That's why I say SB Synergy is the key. My aim is to be the world's biggest shareholders. No need for an integrated brand. They can grow by their own. That's my aim. Ultimately, we want to be a web-based organization. Then we can sustain our sales for 300 years. This happened about 20 years ago. Now we have a lot of group companies in SoftBank Group, Alibaba and so on and so on. So, many has been added, also in addition to mobile. But 20 years ago, there is no Alibaba for us. There was no Yahoo! BB. There was no SoftBank Mobile. Of course, Sprint. No, none of them were there with us. So at that moment, yet SoftBank was very small company, I have already talked about 300 years plan and talked about the ideal web-based organization, synergy group organization. So what I'm saying, talking about this SB Synergy Group, this is not the results that I am talking about. Actually from the beginning, intentionally, we start to design this synergy group, so over 20 years we built this way. And what did we wanted to create? What kind of synergy group that I wanted to create? In one word, group of the number one companies. Easy to say, but difficult to execute, very difficult. So those companies, yellow, reds, greens, those companies in synergy group of SoftBank be intentionally using different brand. They are not using SoftBank something or SB something. That's intentionally did that way. Strategically, intentionally, they are not using SoftBank brand and we don't want them to use it in principle, except for some exceptionals. But, in principle, SoftBank brand is not used and we don't ask them to use it. And the holding ratio, ownership ratio is, again, we're not aiming for 51% or 80% or 100% or something like that. We rather like to see 20% to 30% as our sweet spot. Then, it's easier for us to collect those number one companies. Imagine, I talk to Jack Ma and if I ask Jack Ma, I would like to invest in Alibaba, I want you to use SBbaba, for example. If I said that, if I have said that 15 years ago, 20 years ago to Jack, I wouldn't say that he's going to accept that. Asking for change of the brand, he would say no. If I ask him for 51%, he will say no. If I ask him to change the management, of course he's going to say no. The reason that we were able to create such a number one group of companies, we shouldn't ask too much. And if this company becomes number two or number three, then we may want to exit from this company. But if we had SoftBank something company name or SB something company name, it's not easy to exit the company. Therefore, to create such a number one group of companies, but still it's really difficult to create such organization. You may happen to have one company with number one industry. That is fortunate and lucky. But if you try to have 50, 100, 200 companies of number one in the segment or number one in the country or number one in the world, to create such an organization, to create such a company group, easy to say, but really difficult to actually do that. Actually, there is some organizations similar, but not exactly the same of this synergy group, which is the zaibatsu, a Japanese conglomerate [ph] emerge (00:46:19) type of organization. So, for example, banking, real estate, insurance, trading, chemicals, tradings. So in this, they create a conglomerate that they can do a lot of businesses in one umbrella and it was okay. But then, because it was only the competition in domestic world, but now the competition is the world market, not domestic market anymore. So as of today \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so about 70 years, how are they doing? Are they number one in the world? How many of the number one companies do they have? Actually, most of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 do they have number ones under their umbrella? It's impossible. They cannot have number one banking. They cannot have number one real estate, number one insurance. So, as a result, what happened to them is that only the collection of number 5 players, number 10 players, something like that. But because they are the group companies, so that they prioritize their group companies' products or they adapt group companies to this thing that the weaker becomes weaker. So that even though the group company is number 8 player, but still because they are the group family, so that they have to use them instead of choosing the number one player in outside of their group. So that's how they became. Then it's not a strong group anymore. They cannot sustain as a strong group anymore. They have to choose and adapt not the number one player's product or service. And then they cannot really create a good synergy. Is that the strong organization? I don't think so. SoftBank, on the other hand, we are the group of number one players. So that I think the number one sigma is number one. Easy to say and you may easily understand that, but really difficult to come up with such an idea. Actually, I don't really hear that. Imagine that group companies of number ones, can you imagine anywhere else? I don't. I cannot think of any of it. Any of the companies amongst the world to some extent of the size of the business, I don't really recognize any of the company with the number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only number one players group. Thus actually the synergy group, it's difficult to find such a synergy group and to make that happen, I intentionally \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not to integrate brand amongst those companies, intentionally not aiming for 51-or-over percent of ownership. It's not the result that was originally designed. As a result, 20 years later we became the size of over \\xc2\\xa520 trillion of these investments in the group. So it's not coincidental. It's not the results. It was from the beginning originally designed that way. So to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 against the synergy group, there is a concentration type of business, only for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 pursue one product, one service, one business model. This is also a great model. I think that Steve Jobs pursued that way. And also there are lot of great companies like Intel, Microsoft, is something similar to it, so major successful companies in the world actually taking a strategy of concentration, so only focus on their core business. Then that's much safer and much efficient. Then you can grow, so don't look other ways at all. But if you only like to compete in 30 years, only within 30 years to being number one, then I think that will be a best strategy, very efficient. You don't need to develop other things. You don't need to look for other business. You don't need to take other risks, so very efficient and very appropriate. However, not the 30 years, but when it comes to 300 years, can that product sustain in the market? For 300 years will the business model sustain? For 300 years will business model or your product remain number one in the world? I don't think so. I doubt that. If you compete in the short track, the muscle you use or training you have to go through \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so, for example, Mr. Bolt, who won in world competition, and even though he is very strong in track and field, 100 meter, or short track, he is very strong. But when it comes to marathon, for example, I don't think he'll be number one. So I don't want to be number one for 30 years of competition. I want to be number one for as long as 300 years. That's the organization I want to have. And that idea I came up with 20 years ago, and on that video was a proof showing that I had an idea 20 years ago. In fact, even before the presentation, I had come up with this idea, because I wanted to figure out how we can survive and be successful for 300 years. It's not easy. And you may say that, how can you do that? But at least I try to aim for that and I try to intentionally design organization in such a way that that organization can sustain for 300 years. And SoftBank Group is a strategic holding company holding 20% or 30%, or maybe 50% or 100% if it's a core business or core company, but other than core businesses, SoftBank Group has only 20% or 30% of the ownership of group companies. So with SB Synergy Group, SoftBank Group want to grow as a big tree to capture as many fruits as possible. And accordingly, SoftBank KK, which is domestic telco business in Japan, you may ask why you want to prepare for SBKK IPO, and why you should for parent subsidiary listing, isn't it against the rule and isn't it against the world trend? Well, some people may find it risky or some people may be concerned about those aspects. But as far as I'm concerned, I don't want to pursue small benefit, because fundamentally SoftBank \\xe2\\x80\\x93 SB Synergy Group is there and the SoftBank Group, which is a strategic holding company, should have operating companies that can run on their own. That's why we decided to start preparing for listing of SBKK. And SoftBank Group and SoftBank KK, we want to clearly show our roles and responsibilities of SoftBank Group. For example, SoftBank Group is a strategic holding company, whereas SBKK is a self-driven, flexible, growth strategy can be promoted by SBKK. And also with the SBKK IPO, we can realize value of domestic telecom business. And SBG, some people ask whether SBG will find it difficult to use SBKK's plenty of financial resources. But if you emphasize consideration of dividend policy, we may be able to enhance or improve financial position and we may be able to invest in new opportunities by having a dividend from SBKK, because if it's dividend, we are equal to common stockholders, because those stockholders can have a dividend like SB Group can have. So, there should not be an issue of conflict of interest or unfair concern. So SBG is looking at the world to deliver information revolution, and investors who are interested in domestic business can directly invest in SoftBank KK. As a result, again, like I said earlier, SBG has a strategic long-term view from global perspective, and that's the focus of SoftBank Group, whereas CEOs of operating companies of the group can focus on their own businesses. Now, talking about SoftBank KK, which is our domestic telco that we are preparing for IPO. Domestic telecom EBIT, due to temporary up-front investment, we see some reduction in terms of EBIT. But we want to build customer base, because it's important to look at after IPO in order to continuously deliver results even after IPO, we need to invest first to build our customer base. So, SoftBank KK has been evolving and SoftBank KK will continue to evolve. So, we acquired Vodafone K.K. and, at that time, we had 1.5 million users, but now we have 43 million; and Yahoo Japan, 7 million to [ph] 19 million (00:58:47) in terms of customer number. So beyond carrier is a vision that SoftBank KK has to raise the level. The first wave was PC and second wave was mobile Internet and third wave should be IoT and AI. Those are the evolutions that we are looking at, we have been, and we will continuously looking at. So we want to get ready for the third wave, expand the customer base and generate new businesses. Those are the two reasons why we want to prepare for SBKK's IPO. First, growth strategy or expand the customer base for Ultra Giga Monster and Hikari bundle and collaboration to Yahoo, comfortable online shopping experience, and SUPER FRIDAY, we collaborate with Yoshinoya [ph] beef rice bowls, first food chain (01:00:11) and [ph] 31 of (01:00:13) Baskin-Robbins ice cream, we work with them to provide customer rewards. And customers are really satisfied. In fact, net addition in smartphone has been growing steadily. In fact, we believe that we are the fastest grower of smartphone net addition and churn has been improving. SoftBank Mobile brand delivers large capacity and stress-free experience, whereas Ymobile brand delivers low-price smartphone [ph] debut but lower (01:00:50) traffic user service. So it's like two brands, [ph] Unicom and GU (01:00:58). So, we have SoftBank and Yahoo! Mobile dual brand and both brands have seen growth of smartphone users. It's not just one of them. The fact of the matter is both SoftBank and Yahoo! Mobile have seen a growth in terms of user number. Also we announced a strategic alliance with LINE MOBILE. So on top with that, also FTTH service is making a steady growth. So here, we've been providing a lot of promotions for the acquisitions. So we are making upfront investments for the acquisition of the new customer base as for the preparation for the IPO. And with the customer base, we would like to have deeper analysis with the cumulative generations of the new businesses. So with the customer base that we have acquired, we would like to provide lot of business models on top of that, and that's how we are preparing for. Yahoo! Shopping number of buyers also increasing, and between SoftBank KK and Yahoo Japan for the future role wise what should they do, for the growth what do they do? Not only being defense, but also needs to make offense. That's the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the answer is Vision Fund. Like I mentioned earlier, only for past one year already invested 26 unicorns by SoftBank Vision Fund, and they became our group companies. So that can be 50 or 100. So the top companies, unicorns of the world can be the group companies. Like we established Yahoo Japan, we can create joint ventures. So that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in Yahoo! case, we made investment in Yahoo! Inc. in United States first. And right after that, immediately after that, we bring Yahoo!'s business model together with them to set up the Yahoo Japan as a joint venture. So, likewise, put the monies in Vision Fund, but also at the same time, like WeWork, we set up the WeWork Japan as a joint venture after we made an investment in Vision Fund. And the partner for those joint venture can be Yahoo Japan, can be SoftBank KK. So Yahoo Japan, who has the biggest reach to the customer base in Japan and also the SoftBank KK, who has a very good reach to the Japanese mobile customers, they can be the good partner for the joint venture with those investees. That can be a good strategy for further growth of the business. So not being defense, but to be offense. For example, like I mentioned WeWork, we already have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have launched the office in Roppongi and we have already sold out, right? So we have sold out the office in Roppongi, which we just launched the first of this month and we will have a consecutive launch, one after another, such as Marunouchi, Shinbashi, and Ginza Six. And I believe that they will make a good start. And with Sprint Corp, we would like to expand their business in Japanese market. So this is just one example, but actually we are making a lot of seeding, so that the investee that we would like to create good business in Japan. So that means beyond the carrier. So SoftBank, we are pursuing SB Synergy Group, and I've been saying this about since 20 years ago. And it hasn't been fully understood and fully focused, but I believe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 once again I would like to remind you why we are preparing for the IPO for the SoftBank KK. It's because we need to complete the formation for the synergy group, so that even after I retire, we can create \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the organization still keep growing, so not like zaibatsu, the Japanese conglomerate. But we would like to create the organization, the new model, completely new model, which is similar, but rather like to create such a synergy group, it's my intention, which can keep growing for 300 years. So that's my answers to create the company that keeps growing for 300 years. So what is SoftBank once again? That was the very first question in the first page, is that strategic holding company that keeps growing for 300 years, so generating strategic synergies each other and execute the information revolution that is SoftBank. So that's my conclusion. Thank you very much for your attention.\"}"
