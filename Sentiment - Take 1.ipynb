       " u\"and first of all, network, the softbank network strategy could be applicable to the sprint because softbank's network\\r\\nstructure is the same at what sprint has.\",\n",
       " u\"from july this year, the sprint can use 800 megahertz platinum band because\\r\\nthe company shut down iden network at the end of june and sprint has 1.9 gigahertz on top and also the sprint\\r\\nacquired clearwire's 100% stake, so the clearwire is now the wholly-owned subsidiary of sprint.\",\n",
